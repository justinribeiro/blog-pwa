<p>Since 2002, I've weaved {{ $totalWords | lang.FormatNumber 0 }} words into the an often coherent, sometimes amusing set of {{ $totalPosts }} articles, requiring {{ math.Floor (math.Div $totalReadTime 60) }} hours and {{ math.Mod $totalReadTime 60 }} minutes of reading time. I write on a wide range of topics I find of interest, personally and professionally.</p>

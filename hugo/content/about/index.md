# üéâ Hi.

I'm Justin Ribeiro. I hold some pretty awesome titles: Dad, Husband, software engineer, coach, mentor, voiceover actor, film photographer, executive, ordinary person. I have been told I can be funny (my kids disagree), but overall I try to keep it interesting.

On most days you can find me working on the open web, focused on web performance and utilizing the web platform to bring users a better experience. I also work on a wide variety of other software, from internet of things to containers.

When I'm not working, you can find me hanging out with the family, usually hiking and shooting old film cameras. If it's cold outside, I'm always in one of two places: our darkroom or the workshop.

## üë∑ Profession

I have been building and managing software projects since the mid-1990's. I hold a Bachelor of Arts, Business Administration from Seattle University as well as a Master of Business Administration from University of San Francisco. The reasons behind my lack of computer science degree are quite specific and to many folks, somewhat funny (but that's a conversation over drinks, not for the internet).

I have worked for 100's of companies and organizations. Today, I work with the phenomenal [Tracy Lee](https://mobile.twitter.com/ladyleet) and her firm [ThisDot](https://www.thisdot.co).

I am also a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-justin_ribeiro) in Web Technologies, Internet of Things, and Wearables.  I also write code samples and help make the developer experience better.

Looking for my curriculum vitae? It is available by request only. See the Contact section below to send me an email. I respond to all legitimate offers.

## üíÅ Outreach

I do as much public outreach as I can. I travel and speak at conferences, companies, and schools as well as mentor on a variety of topics. Things I'm either doing or have done lately include:

1. I ‚ù§Ô∏è the open web. You can find me discussing the latest in web platform news and topics on the weekly [The Web Platform Podcast](https://thewebplatformpodcast.com/) with [Danny Blue](https://www.twitter.com/dee_bloo), [Amal Hussein](https://twitter.com/nomadtechie), and [Leon Revill](https://twitter.com/revillweb).
2. I am a former mentor in Pacific Region for Google Developer Groups North America.
3. I have mentored start-ups for Google for Entrepreneurs and University of San Francisco.
4. I've been doing my best to bring internet to those who can't afford it by starting and operating the [Oakdale OpenMesh](https://www.oakdaleopenmesh.org).
5. I have served as President and on the board at the [Oakdale Chamber of Commerce](https://www.oakdalechamber.com).
6. I have sat on the [City of Oakdale](http://www.oakdalegov.com/) Economic Development Committee.
7. I have worked with children through Hour of Code and other science and maker related initiatives.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Contact

You can reach me on places like <a rel="me" href="https://ribeiro.social/@justin">Mastodon</a>. I am on many other social networks (<a rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/justinribeiro">Twitter</a>, <a rel="me" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinribeiro">LinkedIn</a>, et cetera) but the spam has become too much and I no longer read messages there.

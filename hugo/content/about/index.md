# 🎉 Hi.

I'm Justin Ribeiro. I hold some pretty awesome titles: Dad, Husband, Software Engineer, Coach, Mentor, Voiceover actor, photographer, executive, ordinary person. Sometimes I can be funny, but overall I try to keep it interesting.

On most days you can find me working on the open web, focused on web performance and utilizing the web platform to bring users a better experience. I also work on a wide variety of other software, from internet of things to containers.

I am [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/justin-ribeiro) in Web Technologies, Internet of Things, and Wearables.  I also write code samples and help make the developer experience better.

I ❤️ the open web. You can find me discussing the latest in web platform news and topics on the weekly [The Web Platform Podcast](https://thewebplatformpodcast.com/) with [Danny Blue](https://www.twitter.com/dee_bloo), [Amal Hussein](https://twitter.com/nomadtechie), and [Leon Revill](https://twitter.com/revillweb).

## 👷 Profession

I have been building and managing software projects since the mid-1990's. I hold a Bachelor of Arts, Business Administration from Seattle University as well as a Master of Business Administration from University of San Francisco. The reasons behind my lack of computer science degree are quite specific and to many folks, somewhat funny (but that's a conversation over drinks, not for the internet).

I have worked for 100's of companies and organizations. Today, I work with the phenomenal [Tracy Lee](https://mobile.twitter.com/ladyleet) and her firm [ThisDot](https://www.thisdot.co) as well as a firm I helped co-found, [Stickman Ventures Inc](https://www.stickmanventures.com).

Looking for my curriculum vitae? It is available by request only. See the Contact section below to send me an email. I respond to all legitimate offers.

## 💁 Outreach

I do as much public outreach as I can. I travel and speak at conferences, companies, and schools as well as mentor on a variety of topics. Things I'm either doing or have done lately include:

1. I was a mentor in Pacific Region for Google Developer Groups North America.
2. I sometimes mentor for Google for Entrepreneurs.
3. I've been doing my best to bring internet to those who can't afford it by starting and operating the [Oakdale OpenMesh](https://www.oakdaleopenmesh.org).
4. I have served as President and on the board at the [Oakdale Chamber of Commerce](https://www.oakdalechamber.com).
5. I have sat on the [City of Oakdale](http://www.oakdalegov.com/) Economic Development Committee.
6. I have worked with children through Hour of Code and other science and maker related initiatives.

# Hi.

I'm Justin Ribeiro. I'm a software engineer working on the open web, internet of things, and a wide range of applications. You may also know me for my goalkeeping coaching or my photography. I try to keep it interesting.

I am [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/justin-ribeiro) in Web Technologies, Internet of Things, Wearables, and Assistant. I travel and speak at conferences, companies, and schools. I also write code samples and help make the developer experience better.

You can find me discussing the latest in web platform news and topcis on the weekly [The Web Platform Podcast](https://thewebplatformpodcast.com/) with [Danny Blue](https://www.twitter.com/dee_bloo), [Amal Hussein](https://twitter.com/nomadtechie), and [Leon Revill](https://twitter.com/revillweb).

For the last 11 years, I've run a company I co-founded called [Stickman Ventures Inc](https://www.stickmanventures.com). Stickman Ventures is a global company focused on helping companies and organizations build custom software that offers lasting improvements to the way they work.

I do as much outreach as I can. I've been doing my best to bring internet to those who can't afford it by starting and operating the [Oakdale OpenMesh](https://www.oakdaleopenmesh.org). I have served as President and on the board at the [Oakdale Chamber of Commerce](https://www.oakdalechamber.com) and sit on the [City of Oakdale](http://www.oakdalegov.com/) Economic Development Committee. I have worked with children through Hour of Code and other science and maker related intiatives.

## Hello, nice to meet you.

I'm happy to talk. You can reach me on places like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinribeiro), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+JustinRibeiro), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinribeiro).

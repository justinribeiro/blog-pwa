It has been a trying week for many reasons which I can not begin to explain without any due amount of pain.  So, staying positive I look to the brighter side of the Thanksgiving holiday.


I've always found Thanksgiving a time to, if possible, see family and friends.  It has become easier to see my family and some old friends since my recent move to San Francisco.  I do however also miss many of my close friends in Seattle, who I hope to see later in the holiday season.


I feel fortunate that I'm able to see and spend a little time with much of my family, when I know so many can not.  I know that I have much work to do on many projects that will soon come due; but today, family and friends, turkey and stuffing, and laughter and fun will fill the day.


Either that or the turkey will attack us all.  I'm really not sure which.  I'll keep you posted.

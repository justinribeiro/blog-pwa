There is nothing like a wedding, and this one is no exception.  My friends JD and Alisa are getting married today, and I will soon be out the door to their lovely wedding in the specatular <a href="http://www.seattleu.edu/chapel/">St. Ignatius Capel at Seattle University</a>.  If the building's beauty could only match that of the bride, it would be perfect, but alas it cannot.  :-)  She's a pretty girl marrying a handsome man.  Lucky bastard!

Okay, I'm now going to go have a drink before I prepare my toast!  Have a nice day!

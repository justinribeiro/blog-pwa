I finally decided I would have no more of Comcast Cable Internet.  When things were good I was getting 4 down and 368 up and staying connected to my work VPN; when things were bad, I was cut off with no help or concern from support staff who wanted nothing to do with me.

I decided <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net">Speakeasy</a> was the way to go. I had heard good things, and they offer OneLink, a data line like DSL without the need for phone service. I talked to Matt on the phone and told him when I needed it installed by and I was off and running.

First off, the support is top notch so far. Not only did I get Matt's direct number, I was also given an Install Coordinator named Travis who would be my direct contact until the service was installed. When I couldn't meet one of the engineers to verify the line, Travis re-scheduled the appointment. When I've had questions, he's responded within the hour. So far, I'm very pleased with the support staff; they're courteous and really do they're best.

Since I was having a new line installed, I decided it was time to overhaul my firewall. I decided that with my new static IP addresses that I would want to setup VPN (to be able to backup or access files on the fly from anywhere) and a DMZ (just because I had an extra network card). I was simply going to upgrade to the newer version of <a href="http://leaf.sourceforge.net/">Bering LEAF</a>, but instead tried <a href="http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/">M0n0wall</a>. I've got to say, it was easy to install and has a slick interface. It's based on FreeBSD and uses PHP for boot-time configuration and stores system config in an XML file. Of course, I setup the firewall to boot to either hard drive, so I could switch between <a href="http://leaf.sourceforge.net/">Bering LEAF</a> and <a href="http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/">M0n0wall</a>.

But why stop at the firewall and Internet? I ran new cable into my living room for one of my notebooks (and possibly a <a href="http://www.slingmedia.com/">Slingbox</a> if I go that route). Wireless you say? Bah, that'd be too easy. I completely rewired the whole office to be a little bit more friendly and so that I could hook up the final data line connection next week.

What features is the new data line supposed to have? 6 down/768 up with multiple static IP addresses and a shell account for kicks. I don't even have the service running yet, but I'm already loving the support people. I can only hope the service lives up its reputation.

Well, I've been missing in action for the last month.  What gives you ask?  Weren't you getting back on your feet?  Leave it to me to get hurt while at the doctor's office no less, knocking my off my feet for pretty much most of the month.

Couple the above injury with recent MBA program deadlines, and it hasn't been the smoothest time as of late.

But I'm getting back on track, and things are beginning to hop, so hopefully I'm on the right track again!  Now say it with me..."Don't hit your head on anything else."  Ah, yes.

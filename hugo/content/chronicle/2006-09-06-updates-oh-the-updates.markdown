There is so much to talk about, I don't even know where to start.  Okay, I'll just start.

* I'm getting ready to release a new photography gallery.  I've been shooting a lot the last couple of weeks since I've kicked the cold and my camera has been reparied.  Expect new galleries by the end of this coming weekend.
* I finished the redesign of <a href="http://www.yourmediacoverage.com/">Your Media Coverage</a> finally.  It only took me a week, but it seemed like forever.
* There are new short films and cartoons on <a href="http://www.popsecretmountain.com/">PopSecretMountain.com</a>.  The guys have been doing wonders with getting the cartoons out on a weekly schedule.
* It appears the Pink Plastic Flamingo short film will be showing in the local film showcase at <a href="http://www.shockerfest.com/">the 5th Annual Shockerfest International Film Festival</a>.  I'm super happy about that!
* After a few requests, I'm going to be updating <a href="/projects/gtkp_escputil/">Escputil GTK Perl FrontEnd</a> hopefully by the end of the year.  I can't put a time stamp on a new version release date given my current work load, but people have been so nice I just have to update it.


That's all for now, but stay tuned for more exciting updates in the days to come!

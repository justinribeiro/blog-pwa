I've always had a fondness for the large touchscreens. People get such a kick out of using them and building software for them can be both a challenge and lots of fun.

With all the talk of the Microsoft Surface, we decided to make a much larger version of one using a retail copy of Windows 8, a PQ Labs 42 inch overlay (the G3 Plus is in the video, they're G4 series is even faster), and an i7 and SSD based rig to power it.

Our overall impression is that the performance in Windows 8 with the touch overlay is significantly improved. We always fought lag with Windows 7 setups (even with blistering fast hardware), but so far, Windows 8 is proving to be a nicer touch friendly operating system.

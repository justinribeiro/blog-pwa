As many people probably noticed, I didn't publish a single thing in April.  As others noticed, I was incredibly slow to answer email and messages that even hinted at fun and generally was a ghost.  Contrary to popular belief it was not because I turned 30 and was hiding (ha ha people), it was namely due to work related deadlines that kept me on a dead sprint for pretty much the entire month of April.  I honestly don't remember much about April...I close my eyes and all I see is requirements, tax filings, code, and business plans.  Blurry I tell you.

I suppose sometimes that's just how things go.  You've got to make a living, pay those bills and other generic sayings.  So that's what I did and have been doing nonstop for like 40+ days.

Even now, with the sprint seemingly never bound to stop, we're nearing the half way point in May and still no words.  This isn't to say I haven't been working on side projects and tutorials.  There were many a thing I had planned to write about in April that happened in March that simply fell through the cracks.  Mind you, nothing happened in April besides work. But March was creative. :-)

Over the next week or so, I'm going to try very hard to turn those projects into posts.  First up, following this very post in mere seconds, is something that Monica and I worked on that requires chickens.  Seriously.  After that, I'll try to snap some shots of the TZ Artistic film we've been playing with.  From there, maybe a jQuery tutorial.  Sky is the limit right?

Stay tuned.

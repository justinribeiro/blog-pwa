There is something about instant film that appeals to me.  Maybe it's the instant satisfaction, maybe it's the ability to check settings before exposing film.  Nah, it's neither of those reasons.  It's because it's fun.

Say what you like, but shooting instant pack film is just a lot of fun.  My wife and I had used Polaroid for a lot of years and always found it enjoyable.  We'd give pictures to friends at parties, we'd fire from the hip on the streets of San Francisco, they were just endlessly fun.  When Polaroid went by the wayside due to a whole bunch of business reasons I won't go into, like many people it left us a little sad.  Would we ever get to shoot instant pack film again?

With our stock of Polaroid film now nearing its last few sheets and boxes, we decided to order up some FujiFilm FP-100c instant pack film to try out in some of our Polaroid Land cameras.  We'd had heard good things but seeing is believing when it comes to photographic prints (especially in the case of instant film).  Let the testing begin!

FujiFilm FP-100c instant pack film is ISO 100 / DIN 21 film, with color temperature of 5500 (ala, daylight). Most Polaroid land cameras are setup for 75 or 3000 ISO film, so if you're going to drop this in just use the 75 setting (sometimes labeled "color" on some Land cameras).  We dropped this film into a Land 360 and 103 and put it through the paces in a few different situations.

## The good
In direct daylight (where I find most Land cameras perform the best) the film shines.  The colors are accurate, the prints sharp, the development time is about the same as other Polaroid films, and the prints need no coating.  The dry time is pretty quick even in the colder weather we tried it in (half a minute seemed sufficient).

One of the nice things we found was that it was much easier to pull the film from the pack as opposed to the last run of Polaroid we had (which often resulted in poorly developed prints). Edge to edge, the development of the FujiFilm was even and without blotches.

## The not-so-good
Shooting ISO 75/100 film in dim or overcast light has always been hit or miss when it comes to instant film (at least for us).  It can lead to some interesting effects (some beautiful color blurs if you're not holding steady) but also significant lack of sharpness (to the point that even I'm doing a hummm face...and I'm not a it-has-to-be-super-sharp guy). This isn't so much a problem with the film, but rather the lack of control that Land cameras offer.

We found that in overcast sky's, expect to have to bump that exposure compensation at least two clicks over (better known as the lightness/darkness dial on Land cameras).  This resulted in brighter photos, but have a steady hand as the shutter is going to be open a while (based on our tests, it was at least 1/2 to 1/10 of second).

In less than ideal daylight, expect colors that are pretty drab from this film. Indoors with any type of non-5500K lighting, you can expect lots of yellow tinge (as it simply isn't made for that kind of light).  Again, not really a problem with the film.

## Speaking of color
If you're looking for that pastel  color palate and sort of hazy glowing sharpness that Type 669 exhibited, FP-100c is not for you.  FP-100c more closely looks like Type 79 to my eye, with colors that are much more vibrant and much sharper prints than anything we ever were able to do with Type 669.  If you're focus is a little off, you can sort of get that glowing sharpness, but it's really not the same.

## Oh the value
At $8 and some change a box, FP-100c is a little cheaper than the Polaroid used to be. Most people whom have never shot instant film are probably going to balk at the cost (which nears a dollar a shot) and when teamed with a Land camera which can often be tricked (backlighting, oh the backlight blunders), it can be an expensive endeavor.  For us it's worth the price, but you'll have to evalulate your own need.

Is it convenient? No, not all then time. You do have to wait for it to develop, you do have to time that development, then you do have to have a place to store that print and finally find a place to be ride of the trash.

Does it give you super sharp pictures? Depends on which Land camera we're using, but in a 103 and a 360, our FP-100c performed  well.  Focusing errors become quite obvious however (which is no fault of the film).

## The final verdict
We like it and we'll keep using it.  Is it the same as Polaroid?  No, but it doesn't have to be.  It's instant film, and I can only thank FujiFilm for continuing to make it.  If and when <a href="http://www.the-impossible-project.com/">The Impossible Project</a> brings pack film back (they're focused on SX-70 style film at the moment), we'll try that as well. I have to say I might get hooked on the FP-100c before than.

## Next time...
Speaking of the folks at The Impossible Project, I'll be taking a look at the last production run of TZ-Artisitc, which is for SX-70 cameras (if Monica lets me shoot a pack or two).  I'll also take FujiFilm FP-100b (black and white) instant pack film for a spin as well.

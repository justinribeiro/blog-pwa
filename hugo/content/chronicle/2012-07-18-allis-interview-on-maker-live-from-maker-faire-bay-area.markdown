Maker Faire Bay Area (which seems like it just happened yesturday) was another fantastic experience. I took Monica and Alli as per the norm (the twins did not make the trip this time, they're still a little young for that), and we had a great time. Alli got her soldering badge, and she dove right in the kids play area, designing a fan powered boat out of an old toy shell, corks, and rubber bands.

The boat was cool, and we were able to strip a 80mm fan out of an old computer that just happened to have an LED on it. She thought it was pretty nifty.

She wasn't the only one. The nice folks at Maker: Live came by and asked if they could interview Alli, the 6 year old swamp boat maker. She was mighty shy, but also very very excited. See her in action in the embed below (she's interviewed starting at 13:45).

It took me a bit of time to find the clip, but the wait was worth it!

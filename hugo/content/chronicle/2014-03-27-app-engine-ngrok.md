Ever try to use a task queue for App Engine but you find yourself using ngrok for local routing from say a Mirror API subscription ping and it's giving you a ModuleDoesNotExistError because the push queue expects a relative path?

The quick fix is to change dispatcher.py in google_appengine\google\appengine\tools\devappserver2 to not raise the exception and tack on "" to resolve the issue.

Hat tip to Chris Bartling for the [blog post](http://bartling.blogspot.com/2014/01/google-app-enginepython-using-task.html) that sent me in the right direction.

Nearly a month into the new year, and I feel like I'm on a sprint yet again? If you're wondering where I'm speaking in the next month or so, look no further.

1. I've largely become a fixture and host on [The Web Platform Podcast](http://www.thewebplatformpodcast.com). I want to give a big shout out and thank you to [Erik Isaksen](https://twitter.com/eisaksen) who has done an amazing job with the show. I'm just glad I can help. To boot, my company actually became a [sponsor](https://www.stickmanventures.com/blog/2016/02/04/sponsoring-the-web-platform-podcast/) as well (good decision Team Stickman).
2. I'm in Kansas City next week speaking at [GDG Kansas City DevFest](https://devfest.gdgkc.org/) on beacons and physical web.
3. I'll be on the Modern Web podcast next month interviewing (Rob Dodson)[https://twitter.com/rob_dodson]. Should be fun!
4. Speaking of Modern Web, I'll be at the Polymer and Polytechnic hack night at Google on March 16th (come say hi) [http://www.meetup.com/modernweb/events/228534464/](http://www.meetup.com/modernweb/events/228534464/).

I know that I'm missing a few things I can't yet talk about, but be on the lookout! And if you're looking for a speaker, let me know.

title: Stacking up the work

It amazes me that I went from spring cleaning to summer stacks of additional work, all of which seems to be moving at a snails pace to completion.  This makes time hard to find these days.  Hence this rushed update in the middle of the morning.

Let's hit some notes:

* Screenplay goes forward.  TV scripts are outlined.
* Photography expidention at the end of June, if all goes well to scope out sites to shoot movie.
* Been coaching a little youth soccer, mostly goalkeeping because it just sort of appeared one day.
* Scoping two businesses to buy.

Summer Fun!

It's January 15th, and let me wish you all a Happy New Year!  It may be late, but it's still from the bottom of my heart.  I hope everyone had a lovely holiday season and are now enjoying the beginnings of a great 2006.

Since it is a new year, I decided to change around the look of the stories you're reading.  The date is now displayed on the side (ala <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Mezzoblue</a>), and I've written a new category search.  Just click the category on the story posted, and you'll get stories from that post category.  Nifty uh?

Since I haven't posted a photography gallery in a while, I've since added a new one that is semi-proofed.  Head over to the Photography section to see new black and white shots of various shop implements.  I'm learning the Ansel Adams zone system, so please bear with me.

With this being my last year of school (I'll have my Master degree in business adminstration in May) and with a new film project in full swing, it looks to be an exciting year!

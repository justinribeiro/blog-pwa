The days seem to be running together lately, with so many projects to partake in.  You can never enough work they say...or is it you can never have enough fun?  I forget.  Needless to say, lots of things to do, very little time.  The story of most people's lives.


If I told you that the criteria for selecting something was size, credit and financial situations, attitude, and
reputation, what exactly would you think I was talking about?  Well in this case, we're talking about Channel Members, dealing with the marketing concept of channel management).  When these points (as well as others) were displayed tonight in class, I had a hard time not saying "my last date".


Ya, I was tired.  Yep, I'm still tired.  But I still think it's funny.

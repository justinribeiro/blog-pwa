Well, today is the day.  My good friends James and Amy are tying the knot on the lovely country club grounds in Ripon this evening.  The rehersal yesturday was good fun, good food and good people.  The poker game afterwards was also good fun, as the groom and friends played into the early morning hours.


Today's event will be a day to remember.  The key is if I'm going to get any photography of the event, given that I am in the wedding.  This is going to be difficult, but hopefully I'll get enough exposures to pull a some nice prints.


I would also like to say, that I will be busting my best move on the dance floor, since that's what I do.  It seems this can be quite amusing; a few weddings back, the videographer filmed my ass dancing for a good five minutes the bride of that wedding informs me.  And when I say filmed my ass...I mean that literally.

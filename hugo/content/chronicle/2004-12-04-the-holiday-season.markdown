Ah yes, it is the holiday season again.  A time of wonderful decorations, long papers to write, and finals to suffer under.  This will be the first time I've actually taken a final in some time, and yet I suspect it has not changed all that much.


This also reminds me that I may just have some free time to complete a few things that have been sitting on the back burner the last three months:



  * Final script changes, and start shooting my still untitled film.  Finding a title that's right is killing me.
  * Proof and shoot some still photography.  Yes, I have taken pictures, and yes I'd love to post them, and hopefully I'll be able to soon.
  * Continue writing my book "In the Middle" about the funny and not so funny sides of youth soccer referees.


The holidays are supposed to be about fun and being light, but I'm just looking forward to a little free time.

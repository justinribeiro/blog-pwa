Going to be at AnDevCon? Come see me at the NFC Forum booth we're I'll be demoing Android host-based card emulation and Chrome-NFC App integration. There is a small write up and mention available on the [TapIntoNFC](http://tapintonfc.org/2014/11/android-developers-meet-us-at-andevcon/) site.

Hope to see you there!

UPDATE: I'm at Booth 401; come on down and let's talk about some code!

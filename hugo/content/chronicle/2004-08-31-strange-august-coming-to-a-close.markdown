I'll be the first to admit, that it was a very nice August.  Weddings all over the place (of which some I could not attend, but send my best wishes to those who recently tied the knot), new flat, new school, lots of new experiences.


But otherwise, it's just been a very odd August.  I can't really begin to go into the details.  I don't even know where to start.  It was just a strange month.  It could be that I'm just tired, it could be that I'm not sleeping, or maybe my perception is just off center lately.


Odd month.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Makes life interesting.

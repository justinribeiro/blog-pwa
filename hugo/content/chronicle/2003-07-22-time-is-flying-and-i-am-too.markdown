Time seems to be passing at an amazing rate the last month.  This could be for number of reasons, mostly due to the fact I've moved, been to CA, and have the GMAT to take in less then a week.  Couple this with the usual amount of things that are going on, and I'm all the sudden at the end of July.

Time does fly.  Sometimes you just have to run really fast to catch up I guess.

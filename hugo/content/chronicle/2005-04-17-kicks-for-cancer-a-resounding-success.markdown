The Kicks for Cancer soccer clinic was a great success, having nearly 70 kids come out and have a fun time at the ol' pitch.  The turnout was bolstered by the Modesto Bee's <a href="http://www.modbee.com/sports/story/10307443p-11114869c.html">glowing article</a> on Sonia Silveira, who organized the event.  Her goal was to raise $1,000 for the <a href="http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/">Leukemia Lymphoma Society</a>.  With the increased coverage from the article, more donations and kids signed up.  Right now, totals are above the $1,600 level; more donations continue to roll in.

I was at the event, and was able to coach (not only the kids, but help some young coaches) and photograph as much as I could. Sonia, my mom (who helped organize) and I went through the pictures today, and she'll be using some in her presentation about the event for her senior high school project.

Overall, I'd like to say thank you to everyone who came out, all the volunteers, and a big thank you to all those that donated to such a worthy cause.  Thank you!

The other day, I caught That Touch of Mink, with Doris Day and Cary Grant.  Great little flick, one of those ones where your about to do something else, but then end up watching the movie for reasons you can't explain.  Romantic comedy the way it should be done.

On the opposite side of the ball (as in otherside of the universe), I also caught A Clockwork Orange last night. They say there is a fine line between madness and genius, and I think Kubrick was more on the genius side myself, but others might disagree.  It's one of the few movies I've watched where I have not read the book first, in this case Anthony Burgess book of the same name. I think I'll read it.

I love old movies.  Most new stuff just is not that interesting, although I can't say that for all new movies, it would be improper logic.

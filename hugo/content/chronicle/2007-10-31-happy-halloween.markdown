I've been busy and haven't been posting, so let me give you some info as to what's been going on.

* Stickman Ventures, Ltd is going great.  Gareth, Jim, and I have been hard at work on several fronts including:

* <a href="http://www.demodayfinder.com/">DemoDayFinder.com</a> is going strong.  The amount of traffic has been a steady increase, and we're cutting more deals to get golfers the information they need.
* Our current project, codenamed Quirley, is coming along nicely.  We're meeting with and hope to sign on a major mobile phone company in December.

* Monica and I continue our photographic exploits, though I haven't been keeping up posting the galleries.  Our darkroom is pretty much complete (sans press which is on our list) and we're still picking up the odd camera here and there (recently a Canon AE-1 and a couple folders).
* The great web consolidation has begun, at least for me.  I'm preparing a re-launch of a couple of my side sites, including justinribeiro.com.

Otherwise, have a safe and happy Halloween!

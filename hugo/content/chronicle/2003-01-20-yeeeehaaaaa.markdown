The old west seems very appealing to me.  It wouldn't be much different then what I do now, except I wouldn't be in some city, I'd be on a horse and not at a desk, oh and I would like that as opposed to my current situation.  Damn it!  I should have been a farmer, or at the least a cowboy.

Speaking of westerns, they kick ass.  Watching such classics as Hang'em High, The Magnificent Seven, and McLintock! (classic?  Maybe, anything with John being funny is pretty damn good in my book), I find westerns to be quite the way I wish things were.  Even newer westerns with Tom Sellack (who is a great cowboy really, and should be given more credit with the likes of your Eastwoods and Waynes in my humble opinion) still make me wish I was doing something else.

Well, now to something completely different.  Work.  Oh wait, there's nothing different about that at all.

Recently finished fixing up my new weblet look (yes, I had this posted about a week ago, but I've changed some more stuff as well). I'm quite pleased, and I love the Mozilla sidebar.

I'm in the working of creating a new consulting firm, and it's going quite well.  Nice to know I can use that degree in business after all.  :-)

Shows I wish were on DVD right now so I could buy them: (in no particular order)

  * Seinfeld
  * Ed
  * Two Guys and a Girl (aka Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place)
  * Gilmore Girls
  * Scrubs
  * Smallville

I know what you're thinking; some of those shows are still on, and not very far into their run.  Don't care.  I'd buy them all on the spot.

For those of you didn't hear about today's power outage in Los Angeles, if you happened to be visiting any of my sites and noticed they weren't there, congratulations!  You experienced the Los Angeles power outage.


My sites are hosted in LA by Dreamhost, and when the power outage hit, the back up generators in the datacenter couldn't handle the load and stopped.  When power came back up, a switch was out, and hence my websites and email were not available until 9pm PST.  I don't blame Dreamhost for this, it was just a combination of bad timing and some failed hardware.  Could have happened to anybody.


Everything appears to be back to normal, and all is well.

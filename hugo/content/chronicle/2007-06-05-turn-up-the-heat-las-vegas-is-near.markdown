Las Vegas is a funny place; it's hot for so many reasons.


There's the fact that it's in the desert.  The sand on any good day stands a chance of burning you, and the small signs of life lead you to believe that outside the building and city you will likely not live another moment.  You decide to venture out of heat of the day and head into town.


But by the time you get there it's near about dusk, and wouldn't you know it, the bright lights of the strip soon over take you.  You'd think with so many light there'd be something to see, but the only thing I saw was heat waves, marketing, and slightly intoxicated individuals traveling in what I assume were herds.


Of course, just when you enter a hotel casino resort, you think ah, the perfect cool room temperature.  The you see a different form of herds, the scantly clad people.  All of the sudden you feel hot all over again, as the runway show begins.  Skirts that are so short it leaves little to the imagination, and that goes for both the women and the men.


Las Vegas is a lovely town, though I feel I often stay too long.  Eventually most things appear to be happenstance, the plan that was really an accident.  This isn't to say a good time was not had by all.


Spamalot is an amazing show that gives you just enough Python mixed with new golden bits that you'll find yourself talking about a month later.  On a side note, the Grail Theatre where it is playing is a wonderful stage and the Wynn is a lovely resort.


Robin Williams at the MGM was him at his best.  His act contained nothing I'd ever seen him do before, and he transfers so much energy to the crowd that I felt like running a marathon afterwards.


The aquarium at Mandalay Bay was pretty amazing.  The amount of sharks they have is impressive, but the giant sea turtle was well worth the price of admission.  How they set that up in the desert is beyond me.


The Excalibur was an interesting if underwhelming hotel.  The room was wonderful, brand new with a great view.  The casino left something to be desired, and the food in the hotel itself is nothing to write home about.


Overall, not a bad trip.  You can see some of the very interesting pictures as always in the <a href="/photography/">Photography section</a>.

Recieved some email about problems setting up USB camera sync.  I've since added more to the 3100z and Linuc page, detailing with instructions and screenshots how to determine which SCSI device the camera is on (thanks to sg3_utils).

Also, I've hacked up the galleries page again, and added a new top level view, called dates.  It will list the galleries in order, without the full descriptions.  It still defaults to desciption view, since I prefer that one myself :-)

Valentines Day has come and gone.  I hope everyone had a nice time.  I will not discuss my time. (Mostly because I didn't do anything)

Have I mentioned <a href="http://www.chezjane.com">Chez Jane Gourment Garlic Spreads</a> lately?  Yummy.  Go buy some. Mention Justin.

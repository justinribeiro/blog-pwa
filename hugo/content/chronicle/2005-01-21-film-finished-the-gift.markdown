After about three weeks of total time, including the frantic rush to edit the film, lay down audio for the DVD, and setup the cover print, I can say with great pleasure that "The Gift" is finished.


Included on this single disk DVD are:



  * Three audio commentaries, including a wonderful "drunk" track in homage to the Firefly DVD (although we were not drunk, and weren't trying to act drunk, it just sort of sounds that way)
* Actor and Crew biographies
* An inside the set look of the making of film
* A hidden menu, if you can find it


Everything was done in house, from the artwork to the music.  The film runs a little over six minutes long, and has about 30 minutes of extra's.  I am quite pleased with the total product.


We will be distrubuting this film in limited number, since this is only a short film.  If you're truely interested in a truely odd little film (PG rating we'd estimate), let me know.

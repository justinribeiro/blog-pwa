In some spare time recently (of which I have little these days, but then again who does?) it was decided to do something fun and adventerous.  So the lads and I came up with the 1950's horror movie paraody, <a href="http://facebookstolemysoul.com">Facebook Stole My Soul</a>.  

We cranked out a script for the film and decided we needed a trailer. We shot over the course of four days, we built the single set to start in a limited space in one day, and then we cut it together over the course of a week or so.  It was much fun, and the trailer made us laugh.

Since we decided we wanted to make this film (the comedy potential is just gold), we decided to try our hand at <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259865186/facebook-stole-my-soul-1950s-horror-parody-film">Kickstarter</a>.  We we not aware that they had to approve your project, but after a couple days we were approved and off an running.

So, we have 44 days now to try to raise $25,000.  Why so much? It's actually very little when you think about it, but with the fees and making sure we give some really cool stuff to our investors, our current estimate is that we're actually pulling in a little over 17 for the entire film.  It'll be a tight budget, but it's going to awesome.

If your interested in investing on Kickstarter, you can invest as little as a $1.  Head over to our <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259865186/facebook-stole-my-soul-1950s-horror-parody-film">project page</a> to get the finer details of our shooting schedule and plan.

You can also find the trailer on <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/54fc144474/facebook-stole-my-soul">FunnyorDie</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6sB2JsbrEY">YouTube</a>, and of course on our awesome HTML5/CSS3 based site, <a href="http://facebookstolemysoul.com">Facebook Stole My Soul</a> (yes, we went crazy with the poster design site).

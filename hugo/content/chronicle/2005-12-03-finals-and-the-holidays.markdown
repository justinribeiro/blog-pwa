Oh 'tis the season.  Somehow Thanksgiving just flew right by (thank you Mom for cooking a lovely dinner for the family) and here I find myself in December of all months. The time really does fly when you find yourself running around.  With finals bearing down and the holiday shopping season in full swing I'd like to take a moment ot reflect.  Alright.  The moment is over.

For all those people who have emailed recently: I'm not ignoring you, I just have a lot to do. I will answer all emails in the order they were received. Please be patient.

In the mean time enjoy the holiday season, for it only comes once a year.

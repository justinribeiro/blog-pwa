Talk about trying to keep your head above water.  If it wasn't raining outside last week, it sure was raining inside.

I've finished the perl script for the palm to icalendar format, althought it's only command line at this point.  I'm still working on the GTK Perl version.  Not a lot of time these days.  Still trying to work on other things.

And now for a quote, I tend to like, when days are cold and night is night: "for whatever we lose (like a you or a me), itâ€™s always ourselves we find in the sea" E.E Cummings

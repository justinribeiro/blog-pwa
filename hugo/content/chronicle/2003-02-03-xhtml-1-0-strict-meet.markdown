Well, it took me a while longer then I expected, but I finally got around to finishing my standards compliance push.  Everything on the website should be meet XHTML 1.0 Strict.

I've also added my ORIGINAL Advanced GTK Perl GUI up.  It will probably make the next version of ORIGINAL, which you can find at <a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/original.php3">
http://jimmac.musichall.cz/original.php3</a>.  Great software.  I love it and I use it.

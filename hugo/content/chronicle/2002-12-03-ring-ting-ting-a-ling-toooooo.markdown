With added pounds from Thanksgiving, I can now look ahead to the next meal, ah Christmas.  Thanksgiving was a merry old time.  I ate way too much food, much to the pleasure of everyone who thinks I'm looking a little on the thin side these days.

I however did not get to spend a lot of time with many people, and missed some people that I was planning on seeing.  I wasn't happy about it, but since I'll be home in 19 days again, I'm not to worried about it.  I can't wait to see everyone again!  So much fun to have.

I have the LSAT to study for this week, as well as beginning YABP (yet another business plan).  I've also looking to line up some auditions.  Need a superb voice-over artist, or a really great actor?  Well, I'm probably not really your guy, but trust me, I'm not that bad.  See, I'm even funny.

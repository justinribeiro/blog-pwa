I've moved the primary photography gallery detail display off of the nasty tables to a div/css structure.  It uses a series of floating segments inside a div row, of which rows correspond to a year.  The look and feel was not affected by this change.  It does validate as XHTML 1.0 Strict.


I haven't changed the date display over to this format, probably this weekend if I have a chance.

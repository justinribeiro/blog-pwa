Just when you thought I had stopped taking pictures, I go out and release five, count'em five new galleries! Four of them are portraits sessions, and the fifth is photographs from the recent two and half inch rain storm that flooded Riverbank, CA on April 14th.  If you happened to see FOX40 News on April 15th, you may have saw me explaining just what happened (or not, I didn't watch the news I just gave the interview).

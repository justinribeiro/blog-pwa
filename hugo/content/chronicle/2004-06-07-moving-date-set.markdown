I am in the middle of moving plans now, with a date of June 15th as the final move date.  This will be a stop over move in Riverbank while I hunt for an apartment in San Francisco at the end of June/beginning of July.


I've been getting a lot of email and contact form submissions this month, and if I haven't gotten back to you yet, I apologize.  I will try to get back to everyone this week.  Thank you!

Why is it that people who no little about a subject, always give you the worst example of that subject.  Could it be because they don't know anything about it?   I think so.  I mean really, why do people ask me to do something that I know how to do, then feel the need to point me to the worst @#%^$ example to show me how I should have done it.  Leave me be!  I know what I'm doing, at least some of the time.  And if I don't, I'll ask!

I'm going crazy.  I'm almost certifiable.  I'm just driving myself up the walls.  I don't know why.  I just know I'm going crazy.  But if you know your going crazy, does that mean you aren't crazy because you know you're crazy?  Crazy people don't know their crazy, even after you tell them.  Look at all the crazy people on TV, talking about this and that.  They don't know, so they are crazy.  But since I know I'm going crazy, that must mean I'm not actually going crazy.  This is much harder to determine then I originally thought.

I'm leaving.  Time to go.  Must work now.

description: "Not every day that you find 1890's Eastman Kodak dry plates unopened, let alone three unopened boxes that look like they just came off the line. Luckily, we did."

Every once and a while, you come across something that catches your eye for whatever reason, while everyone else is passing it by.  Recently Monica and I found ourselves looking at three brown boxes on a table in the back corner at a photography show.

We hadn't seen boxes likes these before.  The top simply stated that they were Eastman Plates, with the usual "only open in photographic darkroom" and a black chalk mark in the corner stating 15 cents.  Exposed glass plates we thought.  We have a small collection of glass plates of various sizes that we've salvaged and printed over the last couple years (all 1890's America), and my first thought was that we would surely add these to our collection.  We enjoyed them and liked the idea of saving a little history.

Being distracted as I was (my head was on a swivel looking for deals), it was only then that Monica leaned over to me and said in a low voice "these aren't exposed...they're sealed!"  And sure enough, there in front us where three boxes of Eastman Kodak dry plates, unexposed, sealed, as if they were brand new.  The only mark on them was the black chalk of the 15 cents price.

Further examination reveled that they were 3.25 by 4.25 inch "Eastman Post Card" plates or so they were labeled.  Odd we thought, given that from our reading the post card size was 3.25 by 5.25 inches, and that 3.25 by 4.25 inch was considered a quarter plate.  The box did have the company name as Eastman Kodak Company, so they can at the very least be dated after 1892 (when Eastman changed the name: see <a href="http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/kodakHistory/1878_1929.shtml">timeline</a>).

While myself or Monica are not experts on film history, we wasted no time purchasing all three boxes.  We didn't pay much for them, and promised the lady selling that we would shoot at least one of the three boxes.  As crazy as that sounds, we shoot a lot of old film for the sheer fun of it.  The earliest we'd ever shot was from the early 1940's, and having never worked with glass plates should be a new experience.

We haven't been able to find any information about them (yet), but if you have any information or old Kodak literature that might allow us to date these plates do let us know!  We'll post it here and give you the credit.  Below, photographs of one of the boxes.

Had a little bit of time on my hands, and wanted to create a little xml based, css driven weather map.  So, I did.  Check it out, it's pretty spiffy (<a href="http://j5studios.com/weather/index.php">Justin's Weather Map</a>).  I do plan on releasing the code under the GPL, so please be patient.


I'm also heading down to California to look for a new apartment in San Francisco, soak in some sun, and take some pictures. It should be very nice.

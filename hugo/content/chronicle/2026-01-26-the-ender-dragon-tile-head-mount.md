I am nothing if not consistent. Consistent in my love of random holiday presents I make, specifically the variety that no one asked for. I have done this with good regularity over the years; some turn out better then others, and some don't find their way to a write up.

Not this one. This one gets a write-up.

Many years ago when the twins were young, one of said twins had a costume request to be an Ender Dragon. This required much making, as such a costume did not exist at your local former-strip-mall-store-now-Spirit-Halloween location. With the whimsy of parents who love cardboard, glue, and various paints, a costume—complete with bike helmet based dragons head—was created.

A short while after, Mattel came out with a "Minecraft Ender Dragon Interactive Mob Head". I would link to a product listing, but alas all I can find are EBay listings and from what I recall this was somewhere around 2017 or 2018. If memory serves I believe this was the ride-the-coat-tails sort of move given the Chewbacca talking mask craze (was it a craze? It felt like it). Regardless, we bought one at the time, the kids used it three times, and it sat on a shelf that was eventually within my eye line in my office of all places.

Fast forward to last month, it's staring at me while I work, and it hits me: that would be cool as an old school hunting lodge trophy mount. Better: Minecraft item tile style would be superb.

So I did what I always do: I started asking the kids random question. "Do you girls remember the first time in Minecraft that you killed an Ender Dragon? What year would you say that was?" Questions of this type raise eyebrows among teenagers but not alarms. Having pinpointed a rough timeline, I set forth to of all things make a name plate.

This name plate is nothing more than spare foil paper I ran through the printer, cut and then used glue to wrap around a quarter inch piece of pine to make the effect of a plaque plate. Silly place to start a project, but I had to get the proportions right with the mask.

After that, it was a quick build. Scrap boards make up the entire build, roughly 16 by 16 inches. A couple glances at Minecraft tile as reference and I grabbed some acrylic paints and made quick work to come up a palette of color that looked similar. A bit of paint and water for weathering and I had something spectacular.

The mask is mounted to the board using simple screws in the pre-existing fold slots of then mask. The nice thing is, you can take the make off and use it as it was originally intended; no modification required. The rough paint job, in normal not-my-shop-lights, gives it a lovely lodge style feel. If I would have more time, I would have weathered it a bit more, but it had a date with a place under a Christmas tree, so that would have to wait for another time.

In sum total, this cost me no money, no new parts, and re-used an old toy that the kids had forgot about which now hangs in the little loft we have were the kids hang out with their friends. It's a talking point; it's not something you can buy and it draws a lot of "that's cool" from the teenage crowd which is a testament to their kindness and less my hacky maker skills.

Have an old toy you're thinking might work? I implore you to try it; you'd be surprised by the shock your kid's faces may make.

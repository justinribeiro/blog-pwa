Moving into fall, I'll be preparing to make the rounds to a few of Google's developer events:

1. Google Developer Group DevFest talks. I'm working on two talks at the moment (one on Google Glass development, one on Android Wear) that I'll be giving at one of the DevFest events (stay tuned for that annoucement). UPDATE: [GDG DevFest 2014](http://devfest.gdgfresno.com/), being hosted at Fresno City College being put on by Google Developers, GDG Fresno, GDG Oakdale, and GDG Visalia. It's going to be a great event and I hope to see you there!

2. I'm doing a Polymer talk at [GDG Oakdale](https://developers.google.com/groups/chapter/117677091518865462359/) in October. Some of the members of GDG Oakdale and I have had some really solid success rolling Polymer out as part of the [Oakdale OpenMesh](https://www.oakdaleopenmesh.org/). I think Polymer has a ways to go, but as browsers gain native support for the web components implementations that drive Polymer, I expect it to be quite a powerhouse.

3. I'll be at Google's [Cloud Platform Live](https://www.gcp-live.com/) on November 4th in San Francisco. Been working on a lot of Cloud Platform things over the last six or so months that can't be talked about, but it's going to be pretty awesome. The platform has really become really nice to use.

4. The [Chrome Dev Summit](http://developer.chrome.com/devsummit) is November 19-20, with registration opening on September 23rd. I really like the event last year, with solid breakout groups with a good mix of people building on Chrome and the folks building Chrome. Looking forward to talking more about ServiceWorker. Fair warning: bring your A-game or you will get eaten alive. :-)

All of this and I'm in the thick of writing my Glass development book. And next years talks abstracts. And you know, coding. :-)

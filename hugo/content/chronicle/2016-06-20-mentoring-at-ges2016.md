I've done a lot of speaking and mentoring over the years at many venues. This will be the first time I can say the President of the United States will be hosting the event.

President Barack Obama will host the seventh annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) at Stanford University, June 22-24, 2016. GES is a reflection of the U.S. governmentâ€™s commitment to utilize entrepreneurship as a foundational tool to ensure more communities around the world are economically prosperous, secure and globally connected. The 2016 GES is the seventh annual gathering of entrepreneurs at all stages of business development, business leaders, mentors, and high-level government officials.

Just so happens I'll be mentoring startups as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/people/justin-ribeiro">Google Developer Expert</a> and a mentor for <a href="https://developers.google.com/startups/">Google Launchpad</a>. I was kindly invited by the Google for Entrepreneurs team and I'll be mentoring in their Lounge as part of the multi-day event on June 23rd.

If you're attending, swing on and say hi. If you're not, you can always reach out on the social networks.

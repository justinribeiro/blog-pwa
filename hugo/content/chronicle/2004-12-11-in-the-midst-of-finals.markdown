It has been some time since I've last taken a final, the joyous winter occasion when education has you memorize and then promptly forget what we were supposed to learn over the semester.  This is of course my cynical, some what sarcastic point of view of the way finals go.  There is of course a hint of truth in what I say many students would agree. 


Needless to say, taking a final at the graduate level seems to be not that much different from the undergraduate level. I will say that my professors are very open to discuss what is covered on the finals, and are really willing to take extra steps in making sure you succeed.


That said, there is no substitute for studying the material, and for the next four days, that is what I plan on doing.  Two finals on two days.  Let the winter final season begin.

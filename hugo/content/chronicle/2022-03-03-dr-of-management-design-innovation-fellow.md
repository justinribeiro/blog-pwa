In my ongoing attempt to dig deeper into the research space as I follow the path into the woods of this doctoral program, the natural question of fellowships came up in conversation. I had previously been a Dean's Research Fellow at the University of San Francisco during graduate school, where I had operated as an assistant to a professor already doing research which I can at best say was a learning experienceâ€”one I did not wish to repeat. After reading the description for the Weatherhead School of Management fellowship at Case Western Reserve University, I was intrigued:

> The DM Fellowship in Management Design & Innovation is awarded to students who examine problems
of design and the innovative practice of creating and imagining alternative futures in the context of
managerial action. It is associated with the Department of Design & Innovation with a mission of
engaging in research on design in a management context. Any student in the for-profit, nonprofit, or
public sector can apply for this Fellowship as long as their research interest and topic aligns with the
criteria for that fellowship.

Sounded like something I would like to do, I set out to write my proposal and essay's for the fellowship and to my amazement I was chosen, along with a couple of very deserving and talented colleagues in my co-hort (congrats Dan and Pankaj!) . I am truly humbled to be have been selected for the Doctor of Management Fellowship in Management Design and Innovation and am looking forward to expanding my research activities and engagement with practitioners and scholars alike.

Next up: consortium proposals and preparing for my summer qualitative research interview collection.

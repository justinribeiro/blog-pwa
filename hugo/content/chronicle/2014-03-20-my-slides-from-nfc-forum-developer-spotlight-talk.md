Since I'm going to be running around at the [NFC Forum Developer Showcase event](http://nfc-forum.org/events/nfc-forum-developer-showcase/) tomorrow, here are the slides for my talk titled _[NFC and the web:
Itâ€™s happening](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s-QRidCPcyaP8nuiYCuq1Ldr9LuaCLsQ5i11VrexSik/pub)_.

It's a short talk (no fancy crazy demo's or anything this time sorry), but if you want to learn a little bit about the NFC and what the web has to say about it then this is the talk for you.

Hope to see you there!

The holidays are over, and I'm back in Seattle. Yipee. Yes, I'm not too thrilled about it.  I mean really, I love being around family, and I just don't have that here.  It's a crying shame.

Every year, the holidays teach me something new.  This year, I learned that flitering on Christmas Eve with the perfume girl can only lead to trouble.  Second, I learned that sometimes, the best thing to do when your friends are piss drunk, is to just push them over.  Although that has little to do with the holidays.

But seeing my family was great. I got very little work done, although some did get done, mostly by accident.  I saw my friends, which always leads to laughs and some kickass video that should never be shot.  Good times.

I've added some new galleries to the mix, and am looking at finishing up about three dozen little projects soon.  Yipee for me!  But back to work, aka pay my bills time!

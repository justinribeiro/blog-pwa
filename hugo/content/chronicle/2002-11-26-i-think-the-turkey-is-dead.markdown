Ah, holiday memories.  Turkey and lights, cameras and fishing poles.  We had a blast back in the days of filming Your Media Coverage, better known as YMC.  Those days are coming again as our new venture begins to take flight.  Stay tuned.

In other news, after 230 days of uptime, I turned off my LRP linux firewall/router (better known as LEAF these days) and decided I needed to get with the times.  So I upgraded to the Bering distro, and of course hacked it up with some of my custom packages.  Had to go to a two disk setup.  I've got it locked down good, with my new Shorewall custom ruleset. (Not to say the other wasn't locked down)  Very sweet little distro, Jacques Nilo and crew did a fantastic job.

I've also decided after the holiday, I'm going to create a new version of the weblet html files, that are themeable.  The package still uses the old ones, and I haven't had any time to hack up new stuff for over a year, so I think its time to jump back on and get some work done.

Otherwise, I'm going to go catch me some turkey, and have me the hap-hap-happiest time since Bing Crosby danced with Danny #%@&$ Kay!  Ah, the classics...

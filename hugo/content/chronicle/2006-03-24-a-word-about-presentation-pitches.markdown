title: A word about presentation pitches

I had the opportunity to attend the University of San Francisco International Business Plan Competition last night. For those who have never been to such a competition, I can sum it up rather quickly. Teams from all over the world enter business plans that are judged by venture capitalists and industry veterans. They're seeking funding, prize money and respect.

At USF this means that 20 some teams compete over the course of four days. The event is very well planned, and is really a great for people who love the entrepreneurial atmosphere. You get to talk to students with backgrounds in medical science, business, and research; everyone has passion about their idea. You get to talk to VC's who are just dying to put money into the next big thing.

Last night it was the 90 second elevator pitch, where teams have to basically run through as coherently as possible their idea, the problem it addresses, the size of the market for it, and what kind of funding their seeking. It sounds so easy...but it is not.  There were several very interesting ideas, ranging from cancer treatments to carbon nano battery technology.

But while the ideas may have been interesting, the presentation pitches were not. I understand 90 seconds is not a lot of time to explain some very complex ideas, and the pressure is high, but frankly a lot the pitches looked unprepared.  It broke my heart to hear such good ideas destroyed by the lack of a decent presentation.  These people were presenting to almost 20 venture capitalists who could have taken their idea to the next level.  Instead of finding one additional team member who could have presented in a manner that would have been more appropriate many apparently thought the idea could stand alone no matter what.  Let me be the first to say that if you don't have some one to sell it, it will not get sold no matter how good the idea.

This wasn't to say there weren't good presentations.  The top three finishers of the elevator pitch by far had the best presentations in my mind.  They were clear, they were sharp, and they sold me on the idea in the first 30 seconds.

As someone who presents on a weekly basis, I know it's not easy.  But if I were advising some to of these teams, I'd tell them if you have to recruit someone to make your pitch, do so.  Find an actor, some one in public speaking, someone who isn't shaking and swaying on stage.  Find someone who isn't talking at a speed that sounds like a fast forward on a tape deck.  Find someone that has charisma.  It will only enhace the abilty to make that final sale.

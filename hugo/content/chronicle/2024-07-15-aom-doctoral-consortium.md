In the mix of many dissertation related things I'm working, I'm excited to have had my short paper accepted in the Management Consulting Division (MC) Doctoral Consortium at  Academy of Management’s (AOM) annual conference in Chicago (great town, it's been a long time). This will be my first time attending; it's a big deal I'm told. Case carries a lot of weight (example: my dissertation chair, Kalle Lyytinen is giving the keynote for the CTO divison).

The theme, “Innovating for the Future - Policy, Purpose, and Organizations,” really resonates with the topics I’ve been working on. It feels like the perfect opportunity to share ideas, and I’m looking forward to presenting my paper, _Beyond The Merge Conflict: The Effects Of Cognitive Conflict On Developer Creativity And Release Innovation In Open-Source Software Projects_, which ties into this theme in its own way.

I see a lot of names in the program I cite and admire (Eric von Hippel!), so I’m eager to see how this conference plays out.

The Consortium, well, they tend to be hit or miss in my experience (been there done that), but I'm always curious to see where folks are on their own paper journeys.

And it's Chicago, so that's always fun. :-)

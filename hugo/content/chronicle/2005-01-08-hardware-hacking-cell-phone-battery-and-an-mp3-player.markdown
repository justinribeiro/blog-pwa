For those interested, I have posted a new hardware article entitled <a href="http://www.j5studios.com/projects/custommp3player/">"Hacking a cell phone battery to fit an MP3 player"</a>.  Yes, you read the right.  Josh, James and I spent a little time doing some hardware hacking.  A lot of fun, with an interesting finished product.


The article is listed on the <a href="http://www.j5studios.com/projects/">Projects</a> page, or you can simply go straight to the <a href="http://www.j5studios.com/projects/custommp3player/">article</a>.

I'm still getting my bearings on this whole Google Developer Expert thing, but I'm at my first GDE Summit and have a great time talking Wearables, Chrome, Android, Cloud and all kinds of software engineeing. Fantastic stuff and feeling incredibily lucky to be around so many capabable and friendly folks who are sharing all kinds of great insights.

I seem to be losing track as to how many time we've actually attended Maker Faire in San Mateo. Monica and I are pretty sure this was year five, given we took Alli when see was 3-ish. The years kind of wash together.

Monica and I decided we were going to take the twins this year (they're 2.5 years old...it's time to learn to solder kids!), but alas they were a bit under the weather (as was Monica), so for the first time ever, it was just Alli and myself roaming around looking for things to break, buy and fix.

Honestly...it was slightly disappointing this year. Yes, I said it. And yes, I know it's probably not normal to go five straight years. It's not that there wasn't great things to see, but it felt like there was a lot missing. I didn't have a lot of "ohhh I haven't heard about that" or "that is a fanastic design for XYZ! I must know more" sort of moments. Having spoke to a few people whom I expected would have been sitting in booths with new circuit or kit designs, most told me the cost for a booth was simply too high.

Alli of course was on a dead sprint to do all the things and couldn't give two cents as to my opinion. Alli and I talked to the folks doing gigantic bubbles and talked chemistry (Alli, Monica and I are on a quest for 75+ foot bubbles). Alli and I did some crafty things (but alas, no bags this year) and we made our way through the homestead area (or at least that's what I call it) and talked irrigation controllers and chickens.

I was able to meetup with Libby, Keith and company from Society of Glass Enthusiasts SF ([obligatory group picture :-) ](https://plus.google.com/+LibbyChang/posts/CUkoXtH4iZw)). It's always great to see everyone, as I don't often get to all the events in the city. This of course was quickly compounded by the fact that Alli soon dragged me away to something she had to see, hence forth losing said group.

All in all, it was a good day. Alli came away with a few more parts for her ongoing robot build, I got to see a few friends, and we came home with all limbs attached. Next year, health be damned, Monica and I will brave the crowds with all three kids. :-)

I had made a mention the other day that I love [upgrading and keeping my hardware running](/chronicle/2026/02/02/upgrading-a-10-year-old-linux-workstation-against-the-internets-advice/) as opposed to buying new, off-the-shelf gear. The aside note I made around the fact that ongoing growth of AI requires ostensibly more hardware. I say ostensibly most because at some point you hit diminishing returns on those training GPUs folks—you can't out-math the math on your training data.

Which is why when I purchased a new video card as a holiday gift for my nephew this past December, I knew that I was potentially in for some drama. I had heard the stories of bait-and-switch parts, so finding a used gaming card that would last a while for his machine was not so simple. A couple weeks of hunting turned up little and so I did the next worst thing—buy a new, factory sealed box directly shipped from an Amazon warehouse. I'm not having the best of times when it comes to Amazon purchases but my hope—soon to be proven naïve—was that at least they have controls in place for this sort of things.

And so the box arrived, factory sealed and pristine. Then I picked up the box and dread filled me; the box was too light, the weight of a card of this type too little.

Opening the box, I found not the pristine GeForce RTX 3050 I had ordered but rather the crumbled mass of an electro-static bag from years bygone, and in its place a GeForce GT 710, a card first released in 2014.

Had this been just another part for me, I would have been less incensed. Apropos to the holiday however, timing was of the essence. A call and message later, the card was returned dropped off to the wide eyes of a UPS store employee to whom I explained the card in question was not in there: I had been scammed.

The card return was smooth, the money returned, and a new, proper card obtained without additional drama. The holiday, successful.

The struggle of course is that this wasn't some shady back alley deal. This was a purchase from Amazon, not from a 3rd party seller on Amazon. This came from an Amazon warehouse, not some random drop ship. One would expect that this thing wouldn't happen, and yet the scam found me. Where was the infiltration? I doubt this happened in Amazon's warehouse; it does not strike me as a place where [workers have a great deal of downtime](https://www.wired.com/story/tired-filthy-and-overworked-inside-amazons-holiday-rush/)&ast;. Was it the [supply chain](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/dram-shortage-fuels-fake-gpu-scams-as-china-based-fraudsters-exploit-the-supply-crisis-rtx-4080-gpu-sold-at-cut-price-was-actually-an-rtx-3060-mobile-chip-with-fake-vram) which continues to be attacked in new and interesting ways? Why this card; the 3050 isn't exactly the top end for such AI training related tasks.

I have more questions that answers; the arms race endlessly creating these strange and annoying artifacts in the consumer world. Ultimately I have a happy nephew gaming away with his cousins, which is all that matters at the moment.

Until the next purchase.

&ast; I have no love lost for Amazon and it pained me to order from there. I support [unionization](https://www.amazonlaborunion.org/).

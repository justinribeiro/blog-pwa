Besides photography, I have a love of other art forms. One such style that I adore is linocut and reduction woodcut prints. Having tried my hand at the making such prints—Monica is the way more skilled artist in the family in this technique—I understand the patience and time it takes to accomplish. As such, we have a small collection of such prints, which we pretty much exclusively buy directly from artists. I've [written about](/chronicle/2021/02/09/you-call-it-an-art-problem-i-call-it-creative-admiration/) this admiration in the past, and I can attest years later that love and search continue.

While we don't know Ken personally, I had followed his [blog](https://www.kenswinson.com/)—via RSS to boot—and had been a fan of his art for some time. Then I happened to see a post or two of his on the [fediverse](https://indieweb.social/@kenSwinson) around some recent work, and I just could not pass up the opportunity to own a couple of pieces. Fast forward a week and low and behold the lovely pieces arrived.

The technique and crispness, the depth that these prints hold is really astonishing. The twins each declared that that these pieces should be hung in their respective rooms, which is exciting—kids into art is amazing—and annoying—stop trying to steal your mother's and I art. It is a reminder that the real thing beats out anything a digital photograph on the internet can provide. If you have the opportunity, find an artist whose work you love, that brings joy, and find a way to support that creative art form.

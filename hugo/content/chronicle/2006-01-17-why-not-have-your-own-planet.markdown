title: Why not have your own planet?

With little fan fare, my friend <a href="http://www.jamesduvall.com/">Duvall </a>and I have launched <a href="http://planet.j5studios.com/">planet.j5studios.com</a>, a rss feed aggregator based on the great python software <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet Planet</a>.  The look is from the <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">Planet Gnome</a> with some changes I added in.  Overall, it's just a little something to play with, though other people in J5 will be added to the page as they get their own weblogs running.

Think you need to be included in our little planet?  Let me know, we might just put your feed on there.

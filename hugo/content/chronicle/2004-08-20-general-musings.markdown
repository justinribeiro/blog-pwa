I am in San Francisco these days, trying to sort out the many things that you have to sort out when moving into a new place.  I've gotten a lot of the unpacking done, which I really hate to do.

I've gotten my broadband access in place (Comcast) and am now going to try out voice over IP phone service with Vonage.  So far, I'm pleased with the call forwarding and virtual phone numbers.  I'm hoping the service works as well when the device shows up.

I'd also like to point out I'm just now gained Internet access for the first time this week, so I'm catching up on my email.  Please be patient.  Thank you.

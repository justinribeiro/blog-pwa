It has been shall we say, an interesting week.  I started off the week blazing mad about a class and have now toned it down significantly since having that class this morning and having a lengthy email conversation with professor.  I'd like to say that I'm pleased that he's being open with me about the issues I given rise to.  Honestly, I expected the worse; my luck hasn't exactly been the most stellar as of late.


On a high note, I did give a 90 second speech this morning that I must say was quite good; the audience response was unexpected.  As Mark Twain once wrote in the <i>Californian</i> "pay no attention to the papers, but watch the audience".  Honestly, some of the better speaking I've done as of late (I've given two stellar presentations and had two part locking auditions this month as well...and this was better).  I had little time to prepare it, and wasn't planning on using the story line, but decided to give it a go.  Something the professor said just triggered it, and I have no idea why.  I give writing credit to my good friend, business partner and additional brother James Duvall, since his monologue was the original inspiration.


The unexpected effect of giving this speech, besides getting some practice in, was that having talked with Duvy today, we've decided to finish a screenplay based on the original monologue entitled "Striking Christmas".  The screenplay will more then likely be a dark character study about one man and his family coping with the loss of brothers many years in the past.


In the mean time, filming begins at the end of this month on our new untitled mockumentry dealing with pirates.  Yes, pirates.


This was a low to high back to low again week.  What is the final low part you ask?  Midterms this coming week, a business deal to close, working out this class problem and getting my car fixed.


I know there's more to life the working all the time.  I just can't see the life through the work.

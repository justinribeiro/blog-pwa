Let's all catch up.


    * Classes are keeping me busy, and no doubt as December approaches, my time will continue to become more limited.
    * I'm currently working on a new business plan for one of my classes, which deals with re-opening the Women's United Soccer Association in a new format that actually makes a profit.  The Women's Soccer Initiative is supposed to be working on this as well, but I've decided to write up my concept nonetheless.
    * I've had the fine opportunity to meet and talk with executives from various companies over the last several weeks, thanks to John Durham. He's a class act, and all I can say to him is thank you.
    * I recently had new personal business cards printed.  If you see me, ask me for one.
    * Speaking of new business cards, I purchased new Los Angeles and Seattle phone numbers just to put on the card.  I'm making a push to become more global.
    * I have some new photographs, but have not had time to proof and post them as of yet.  Hopefully this coming weekend will give me some time.

That's all the time I have for now.Â  Stay tuned for more up to the week news!

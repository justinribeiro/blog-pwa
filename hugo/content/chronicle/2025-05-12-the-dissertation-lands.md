After much editing, paperwork, and general waiting, my dissertation—[Creativity in Conflict: A Multi-Level Exploration of Software Developers’ Capacity to Innovate](https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=case1743683688353522)—has finally been published.

Many thanks again to my chair [Kalle Lyytinen](https://case.edu/weatherhead/about/faculty-and-staff-directory/kalle-lyytinen) and my committee [Neil Maiden](https://www.bayes.citystgeorges.ac.uk/faculties-and-research/experts/neil-maiden), [Philip Cola](https://case.edu/weatherhead/about/faculty-and-staff-directory/philip-cola), [James Gaskin](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=5438), and [Aron Lindberg](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/alindber) for their amazing support and effort in this (lengthy) endeavor. And thank you to the amazing staff and colleagues at [Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/weatherhead/): the rigor is real. A full set of thank you's and acknowledgements are in the dissertation and also [reproduced in a previous post]().

Don't give up on your creativity developers, and don't stop having those social conversations that temper that creativity into innovative outcomes (with actual human people). ♥️

Now time to cut it up and start publishing.

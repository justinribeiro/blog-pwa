I've been all over the place it seems.  I've gotten quite a bit of email lately from people who have questions about LEAF, Epson 3100z and Linux, and some of my other software.  If I haven't gotten to your email yet, please be patient, I'm answering them as fast as I can.

I recently made a jaunt home for a brief couple days, and if I didn't catch you, I apologize.  It wasn't really a planned trip, something that just had to be done.

Otherwise, my Giants are 6-0, and hey, you gotta love that.  Also, congrats to the San Jose CyberRays for taking their first game of the season 1-0.  For those of you not in the know, they are part of the <a href="http://www.wusa.com/">Women's United Soccer Association</a>.

Oh, and go <a href="http://www.mcfc.co.uk/">Man City</a>!

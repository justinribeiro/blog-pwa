When we first wrote Ginger, a WebGL morph target experiment, back in late 2011, we didn't know the impact it would have on people. Little did we know it's become hugely popular on +Chrome Experiments and remain that way for so long. We get email constantly about it and people just really dig it.

But Ginger had issues. It was late 2011 when we wrote it; it wasn't mobile friendly (WebGL on mobile in 2011....ha! funny joke). The web since then has gotten even more awesome. So the folks and I at the +Stickman Ventures, Inc. office decided over the holiday to revisit Ginger and give the demo a little love.

Hence, the new and improved progressive web app version of Ginger!

I also wrote a fairly length post on our corporate blog:

We even open sourced it:

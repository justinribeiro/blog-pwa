Now, I've been around the block when it comes to hosting web sites.  I've done my fair share in my time, from dedicated solutions, to small shared plans, to data bunkers.  All have their strengths, as well as weaknesses.

But over and above, the very nice people I've done my hosting with for the last four years, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi">Dreamhost</a>, just keep giving more features at a price you can't beat. They've got a great $19.95 a month plan that has many features you can't find elsewhere, with 1.6GB of space to top it off.  I myself just ordered another shared server plan, and upgraded my existing account.


I know this sounds like a commercial, but when a company actually delivers (trust me, I know many that don't) they deserve a word of praise.  <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi">Dreamhost</a>, I say thank you for continuing to hook me up!

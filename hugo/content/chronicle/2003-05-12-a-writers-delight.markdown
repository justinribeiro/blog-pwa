I've been writing a screenplay based on my yet as unfinished book, which shall remain nameless (mostly because I have not come up with a title yet).  I will tell you that it's based on true stories I've researched and lived, and that using screenplay format, I've got roughly about 25 minutes of actual film time (for those who do not know, a screenplay is written such that roughly one page equals one minute of screen time.  Hence, 25 minutes = 25 pages.)

Other things of interest include my recent loss of my trusted Palm V.  She was on her last leg, through almost four years of abuse.  She will be missed.  So, I had to pick up another palm.  Why not a slick Zaurus you ask?  Mostly because I've got a lot of data in formats I can't convert over (actually, because I don't have time to convert my custom apps over), so I picked up an m515.  Yes, no OS 5.  No high res.  I didn't need the bells and whistles.  I just needed my existing stuff to keep working.  I would have bought a m500 (yes, I like greyscale), but I couldn't find one on short notice.

Many thanks to Chris Rosolowski for hooking me up with a sweet autoload trick for USBCS, and testing it with the Fuji FinPix 2400Z.  I'm going to write a page up on getting it to work, with all the credit going to Chris.

I also heard today, that NBC has renewed "Ed" for a forth season!  This is great news, for a great show.  It is my favorite show on TV today, since the X-Files has been gone. Quality writing, which is hard to come by in with all the poor reality TV programming today.

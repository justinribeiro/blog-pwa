The <a href="http://www.sfbig.com/">Bay Area Interactive Group</a> (better known as SFBig) held an event yesterday that was very interesting.  At this evening event, I was able to hear Sean Connolly (Worldwide Director of Advertising at Intel), Pat Connolly (Chief Marketing Officer at Williams Sonoma) and Rich Buchanan (Chief Marketing Officer at Sling Media) answer questions and discuss very aspects of marketing.  Each of these companies is very different, yet the need for integrated marketing communications and the advent of interactive online advertisements seems to weight heavy on each. The talk was very enlightening into what not only these companines are trying to do, but also that implementation of plans that have global reach.

Of course, the panel was nice, but the ability to actually talk with these individuals was fascinating.  The amount of information you learn by simply asking a question and listening is great, and contrary to what many people might think, they€™re very approachable and open to talk with you.

Interesting enough, Mr. Connolly pointed out the Williams Sonoma accounts for one percent of the US Postal Mail volume by weight.  That's a lot catalogs, and yet he also noted that online sales continue to see year over year increases.

I can€™t speak highly enough about the organization and it€™s president/founder John Durham.  He€™s an amazing guy, and the people he has introduced me to continues to amaze me.  He knows everyone, and has such a keen sense of the advertising and agency world that I can only hope to continue to learn from him.

Yestuday, will listening to the radio at 5 in the morning, the DJ and producer got in a heated argument about playing some song because of the content of the song.  The DJ didn't want to play it again, because he though they should be responsible, while the producer didn't want to sensor content.  I tend to agree with the producer, but it doesn't much matter because generally speaking, radio sucks.  I get tired of hearing top 40 hits of any variety of music.  It even seems listening to classical is not immune to this.


This leads me to <a href="http://www.garageband.com">GarageBand.com</a>, which was has the 1.7 million songs MP3.com used to have.  They have some very good independent artists there (at least in my sampling of Folk/Country category), and you can download for free.  I'm actually more inclined to buy music from these "unknown" artists, since they actually get a good proportion of the sale.  At least they have a somewhat fresh sound.  Good stuff.  You should check it out if you already haven't.  I'm glad I finally got to it!

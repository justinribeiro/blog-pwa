<p align="left">On February 2, 2008, I asked Monica to marry me.  She said yes. We were both happy.

<p align="left">This all seems so simple, a question, an answer, happiness abounds.  Getting to the actual point of the question and the subsequent set-up was not so easy.  It was a calculated choreography of several key factors that had to all come together to make the question as perfect as could possibly be.

<p align="left">Flashback to several months ago.  The planning begins in earnest.  I had heard all matter of stories pertaining to the asking of the question, and tried to come up with my own spin on the idea.  One of the more interesting stories was the gentleman who takes her for a walk on the beach when a diver comes out of the water, cracks open a clam, and low and behold a ring and said question.  I heard this from a number of people, and while I did not research the story to it's truth, I have to say I'd be impressed too.  But was that right for me, or rather still, her?

<p align="left">I looked around for romantic places.  I toyed with remote locations requiring travel by air and sea.  I considered trained monkeys with jet packs.  Nothing seemed quite right, though most of my over the top ideas seemed inline with my typically over the top style of doing such romantic gestures.

<p align="left">With my planning of the actual question popping location going nowhere, I switched gears and begin to explore the wonderful world of diamonds and rings.  I by no means am a connaisseur of all things sparkly. I traveled from jewelery store to store seeking out something that spoke to me.  While a lot of rings talked, I found the sales staff to be just as chatty.

<p align="left">For the most part, the sales staff at most of the stores I visited attempted to be helpful.  Most stores had pretty much the same style and selection as other stores, and most of the styles to me personally looked generic.  One sales rep went so far as to inform me that if I didn't pick one of their somewhat standard styles, that my fiancÃ©e would probably be disappointed since that's what the current style is.  When I explained that I'd like something more classic, something Art Deco or Art Nouveau style, I was greeted with a blank stare.  This was not the jewelry store for me.

<p align="left">According to the growing stack of business cards in my office, I had visited 23 jewelry stores and had come up with nothing.  On a whim I decided to visit one more store that fateful Tuesday, the storied <a href="http://www.tiffany.com/?siteid=1">Tiffany and Co.</a> in Union Square in San Francisco.  This was as much a shock to me as anyone, because I expected one of two things to happen.  One, I find something that speaks to me and they tell me it's $50,000, or they kick me out for wearing runners, jeans and a tee shirt.

<p align="left">It was here that I met Joesph,  a third generation jeweler and a very likable guy who would guide me along the path to my ring buying decision.  When I asked what they had to offer in a Art Deco or Art Nouveau style, he replied that they didn't have anything Art Deco, but had something Edwardian, which draws influence from Art Nouveau.  When he showed me the ring, I knew we had a winner.  The Tiffany and Co. Legacy ring just jumped out of the case, and was exactly what I was looking for.  He agreed to bring in some other rings from for comparison in the same style, and that I could decide then.

<p align="left">With the ring buying decision all but complete, I again focused my attention on the location and the whole setup.  After racking my brain for a few weeks with ideas of grandeur, I decided I was over thinking the whole thing.  I needed some place that just spoke "surprise!", some place she would not expect to be taken.  I looked for a combination of seclusion, ocean, and breath taking views.  It was then I came upon the <a href="http://innabovetide.com/">Inn Above Tide</a>, a lovely inn in Sausalito that had suites over the water (yes, over).  I soon found myself reserving the Vista Suite, complete with jetted spa tub, private balcony, wood burning fireplace, and a view that is unsurpassed.  They would have fine champagne waiting in the room, and it was set.

<p align="left">With the room set, I again focused on the ring.  Joesph had brought in a series of rings that I looked through.  He explained their subtle differences and didn't push me to buy any of them.  As I looked though the rings and sipped Tiffany branded bottled water, I had come to the conclusion that she probably wouldn't expect to be taken to a lovely inn on the ocean and handed a Tiffany and Co. ring.  This was turning out rather well.

<p align="left">As I walked out of the store into the pouring rain on that Thursday afternoon, a blue Tiffany and Co. bag containing the ring firmly clutched to my chest, I believe I was in good shape.  I just had to get her to the inn without her knowing we were going to the inn.  I'm not terribly good at surprises, and keeping this one was going to be down to the wire.

Lots of things going on as of late that has kept me away from updating the site lately.  Lets hit the highlights shall we?

* The crew and I have been shooting commercials as of late, which will be online in the next week.  They're very professional, shot with a Canon XL2 and some great sound gear.  We've done TV spots for a winery, card throwing league, and are working on a new short film.
* Preparing to finish up my MBA in the month of May.  Graduation in mid-May seems so far away at the moment.
* I'm still working on two business plans, and have made good progress lately.

Only three points, and you call yourself busy you say?  Trust me...so much to tell, but I just can't show you my hole cards just yet.

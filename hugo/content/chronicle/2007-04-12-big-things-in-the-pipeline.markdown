Things have been at a slow simmer over the winter it seems.  Having been sick it seems like for most of that time, not much has been going.  But there are big things in the pipeline.  There would be nothing better then for me to spill the beans, but I'm holding my cards close to my chest.  Everyone will just have to wait in see what's in store.

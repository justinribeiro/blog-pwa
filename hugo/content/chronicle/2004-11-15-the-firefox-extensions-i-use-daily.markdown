The other day, someone asked me which extensions I was using in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> these days since the 1.0 release.  I use quite a few on a daily basis; some for web development, some for general usability, and some just because. I've therefore decided to break out the list of extensions I actually use.


The first list we have today we can call the development list.  These are the tools I use to develop or test web applications (not doing that much these days, but handy none the less):


  * DOM Inspector
  * Web Developer
  * wmlbrowser
  * User Agent Switcher
  * Nuke Anything
  * LiveHTTPHeaders


This second list is general usability; quick clearing of cached data, search tools and backup.  Of course, a spell checker as well, so I stop misspelling words in web forms:


  * Toolbar Enhancements
  * Popup ALT attribute
  * GoogleBar
  * Bookmark Backup
  * GooglePreview
  * SpellBound
  * Paranoia, better known as x


I like to say you can just go to one web site and get all these extensions...but I've found that doesn't really work out.  So I go to three:



  * <a href="https://update.mozilla.org/">https://update.mozilla.org/</a>
  * <a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/main.php/Firefox">http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/main.php/Firefox</a>

  * <a href="http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/">http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/</a>


Typically, those three sites will have everything you need, although you can usually find the developers website which will have the latest greatest versions of their software.

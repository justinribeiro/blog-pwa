So I've been playing with Opera Mini 4 Beta 2 on my Treo, in hopes of finding a suitable replacement for doing web work on the road when I'm sans notebook (or just feeling liking posting something).


The fact that I had to re-install the Java virtual machine again (which I periodically remove when it angers me) was of little consequence.  I have the space, but the JVM on Palm is at best not very good.  It just doesn't run well and the more recent versions are not complied for Palm as far as I know.


Opera Mini 4 Beta 2 makes me happy, if it would run a little better.  It offers a far better experience then Blazer and for those inclined offers a similar zoom feature found on the iPhone.  The speed offers something to be desired (which I blame half on the EDGE connection, ATT).  The JVM bugs seem to be a particular problem (as it seems to run fine on Nokia handsets just fine), as I often stall it out and have to reboot the phone.


Opera Mini 4 has some great promise, and I can't wait until the final version is released.

What a great title.  It has nothing to do with what I'm about to write.  But striking isn't it?  I like it.  It brings a smile to my face, in the face of the down pour I like to call, wash away everything in Washington.

Yes, its raining cats and dogs, and I think I saw an elephant.  Need less to saw, I had to canoe in to work today.  I would have sailed, but my sailboat is in the shop, under going what ever sail boats get fixed for.  I think my had a hole in the hull.  Hence, why it sank.  But that's another story.

The rain doesn't get to me that much these days.  Yes, since everything is a black and white movie these days in Washington (aka grey all the time), it is depressing.  But hey, it's the holidays, and I'm going home to California where it's...grey with fog.  Actually, it's been raining, but I've got a much better chance of actual sun and blue skys there.  And theres family.  :-)

And so, as I head off into the storm that is holiday shopping, I leave you with these magical holiday words.

"Happy, happy Christmas, that can win us back to the delusions of our childhood days, recall to the old man the pleasures of his youth, and transport the traveler back to his own fireside and quiet home!" - Charles Dickens

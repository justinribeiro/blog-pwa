I happy to announce that my talk proposal, "<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2013/sessions/merging-technologies-bring-3d-printing-status-web">Merging technologies to bring 3D printing status to the web</a>" has been accepted for EclipseCon 2013 in Boston!

As many of you know, I've been working on bringing MQTT support into ReplicatorG via Eclipse Paho, but beyond that bringing those updates onto the web Internet-of-things style. If you don't want to click through to the talk session page, I'll be covering:


* Integrating Eclipse Paho into ReplicatorG to handle M2M messaging with MQTT
* Integrating GSON into ReplicatorG
* Building ReplicatorG with Eclipse
* Building a web socket server using pywebsocket
* Building a response site that using HTML5 web socket API


I do want to bring one of the Replicators out to the conference (there's nothing like real time demos...as long as they work :-). I'm looking forward to giving the talk and mixing it up at EclipseCon and hope to see you there!

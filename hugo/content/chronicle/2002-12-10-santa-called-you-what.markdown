I saw a woman attack this man in a Santa suit the other day at the mall. She though that his Ho! Ho! Ho! talk was directed at her. Of course, I guess Santa was justified, spreading holiday joy and what not. Bad set of circumstances I guess.

I took the LSAT last weekend.  Hard little sucker.  I mean, I should have really looked it over before I took it.  People are sitting, talking about how they studied for months, and I'm just sorta kicking it.  I mean months for a test?  What is this, the bar exam?  It's only to get a chance to possibly go to school, to then take the bar exam.  I mean, really.

While failing the LSAT, I begin to think about number two pencils.  Why does it always have to be number two?  If I use a number one, does that mean the test machine that reads it will explode?  Also, if I were to take a number two pencil, and break it in half, would I then have two number one pencils?  If I used one of those on the test, would the world end?  For the record, I did use a number two on the test.  I also used a number 1 1/2.  If the sky starts to fall, you know who to point a finger at.

I've updated the galleries as well as the script again.  EXIF info is now displayed, if available.  I sorta lost some of the EXIF info on some of my images, since I rotated them in GIMP, and GIMP doesn't save EXIF.  I believe there is a patch for this, but, I'm not running it yet.  I'm heart broken, but not really.

I'm porting the perl script that makes my galleries to windows, for my siblings to use (No, I have not converted them to linux, although they're loving Knoppix, so it's only a matter of time).  It's a work in progress, hopefully my siblings will soon be able to use it.  (I'm running RedHat, so I don't have any use for it)  The GTK Perl version is much better.

Until next time, have a very merry, happy joyful, holiday season!

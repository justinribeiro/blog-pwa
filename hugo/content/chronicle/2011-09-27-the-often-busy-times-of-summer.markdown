Summer seems to have come and gone in a blink of an eye. The days can be long but the years seem to get shorter as time goes on.  There are draft articles on my desk, presentation proposals for next year waiting to be finished, and projects galore happening. Maybe now would be a good time to reflect for a moment on what exactly has been happening of late.

* Monica and I had twin girls on September 16th, Isabella and Evelyn. They're cute (they look like their mom, thank goodness) and everyone is doing well. I am officially outnumbered. Painted toes and daddy make-overs are pretty much my life from here on out. 
* Alli's ability to play the piano only continues to impress me. It sounds so sweet when she writes new little songs. 
* Stickman Ventures continues to grow. We opened an <a title="Stickman Ventures open office on Oakdale, CA" href="http://blog.stickmanventures.com/2011/08/18/a-new-office-in-oakdale-ca/">office in Oakdale</a> recently to house some ongoing product work, among other development things. 
* It's not secret that I've been writing articles over on the Stickman blog, everything from <a title="TimThumb Wordpress cleanup" href="http://blog.stickmanventures.com/2011/08/25/dealing-with-compromised-wordpress-blogs-via-the-timthumb-vulnerability/">TimThumb wordpress cleanup</a> to <a title="PayPal X Android library wifi problems" href="http://blog.stickmanventures.com/2011/06/06/the-chase-for-the-wifi-only-device-fix-for-paypal-x-mpl-on-android/">PayPal X Android lib problems</a>. 
* The bigger hit of the summer was the <a title="Ginger WebGL demo in three.js" href="http://stickmanventures.com/labs/demo/webgl-threejs-morph-target/">Ginger WebGL demo</a> that David Steele and I worked up.  I worked on the JavaScript portion of it, David did the heavy lifting in Maya.  People like it, it even made <a title="Chrome Experimenets Ginger WebGL facial rigging" href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/ginger-facial-rigging/">Chrome Experiments</a>.  It's a piece of a much larger animation tool that we're working on. 
* The darkroom was not terribly busy this summer; I never had the opportunity to add the air conditioning unit into place to make it workable, even in the cooler summer we had. Winter printing is looking very enticing at the moment. 
* We didn't reach our funding goal for <a href="http://facebookstolemysoul.com/">Facebook Stole My Soul</a> on Kickstarter. The website is oh so pretty though. 
* A lot of people keep asking about the tree house, and to be honest, the tree section is sitting in the garage. With Monica pregnant, I didn't have an opportunity to put the required work into it to get the tree house completely retrofitted. 
* I keep getting a lot of questions about Coldfusion and Salesforce integration. To be honest, yes, I know how to do more beyond the older examples I posted. But if I'm being really honest, I don't want to write it up. I only use ColdFusion for the client projects that require it, I don't personally use it and I just don't have the passion to sit there and setup the examples to do so. It's not personal. 
* Speaking of which, it pains me to look at my own site at the moment. I crave to update the code base, but I have yet to find the time. 

Travel didn't take a great focus personally this summer; when you're wife is carrying twins, it's best not to move her to fast or take her on planes (crazy doctors and their rules). But I did make it to few conferences I never had time to talk about.

* Google I/O and Bootcamp were very awesome experiences. I though the sessions were very good (<a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/index-live.html">you can catch them online</a>) but being able to get straight answers from the engineers was the best part.  They were very approachable and willing to talk and I came away with a greater understanding on Android, App Engine an Chrome. I can understand why they keep it small (I can only imagine how overwhelming it would have been for the engineers and staff), but I do wish the people that only attended for the swag would have stayed home. 
* The jQuery Conference in San Francisco was very good. I was able to meet some of the folks from <a href="bocoup.com">Bocoup</a> and the jQuery team and the session speakers were top notch.  I unfortunately won't be attending the upcoming event in Boston due to other commitments. 

I'm sure I'm missing about 27 other things (the summer did happen, it's just very blurry at the moment). But an short update is better than no update.

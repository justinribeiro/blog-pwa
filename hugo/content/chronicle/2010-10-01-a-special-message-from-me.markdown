It's a jogathon people.  You know your school is having one soon.  And I'm trying to help Alli collect $2, yes that's right, just $2 from you.  Send it via PayPal to justin@justinribeiro.com that way you don't get my cold.  She's collecting donations accepting money until October 4th.

You know you want to.  The children will treat you as a conquering hero for helping them learn.  Look, there's even a really easy button to press.  And a promotional video.

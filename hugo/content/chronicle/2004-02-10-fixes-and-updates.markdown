Have installed some new fixes to take care of some bugs on the website.  The include:



  * Dropdown menus now pass XHTML Strict thanks to the csshover.htc from Peter Nederlof (<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~peterned/csshover.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~peterned/csshover.html</a>) which takes care of the :hover issues in IE.
 * Fixed the incorrect sorting of images in the Photography section.
  * Fixed the "more information" link to work more smoothly.
  * Updated to the latest Exifer 1.4 library from Jake Olefsky (<a href="http://www.offsky.com/software/exif/index.php">http://www.offsky.com/software/exif/index.php</a>) and tweaked my EXIF "more information" display for the photography section.


These little changes have made quite the impact, and really smooth things out.


I'm also still pissed tht Ed is likely to be canceled.

This is one of those quick notes for folks who may be thinking, hey, I'd love to get a [Carter Cobra Coil™ band saw tension spring replacement](https://carterproducts.com/band-saw-products/band-saw-tension/cobra-coiltm) for my 14 inch bandsaw. I thought the same thing; it would be a nice upgrade and I was in the process of replacing a broken bolt—my fault, not the bandsaw—so figured this would be an opportune time for an inexpensive upgrade.

Alas for my bandsaw, specifically the older non-BLK version of the [JET JWBS-14SFX](https://jettools.com/14-inch-sfx-jet-black-woodworking-bandsaw), I found that it was very clearly not supported (see image below). The size difference is a non-starter with the spring being nearly 2 and a 1/4 inches and my JET OEM spring being just sy of an inch and 1/8.

I don't blame Carter for this; they say specifically most saws, I could tell from the product image that this was in the maybe-it-will-work category. Even after I could find no information in any of the woodworking or other tooling forums regarding if anyone had tried it on my model, I still took the $20 dollar chance knowing I could return it.

It did not work. Could I have made it work? Not without a enough intervention to dissuade me from doing said tool modification. Item returned, no harm, no foul.

This by no means will prevent me from buying Carter tools; they make some lovely stuff. Hopefully this post is just helpful information if folks are looking for compatibility help.

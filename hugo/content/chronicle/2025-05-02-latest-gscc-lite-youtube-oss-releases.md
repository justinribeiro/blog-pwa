Catching on my what is an endless backlog of community (and my own for that matter) requests for additional features and bug fixes. I didn't make it to everything in the last week, but we're making progress after a period of me being ill on top of PhD activities (now largely wrapped up).

* v4.3.0 of [Google Scholar Citation Count for Zotero](https://github.com/justinribeiro/zotero-google-scholar-citation-count) includes new features including automatically pulling citation count on item added to your Zotero library (which must be enabled via the associated preference), new relative relevance score column as recommended by the community (see [issue #28](https://github.com/justinribeiro/zotero-google-scholar-citation-count/issues/28) for details), and now I have now finally added user feedback to the update system, showing a small popup in Zotero when pulling citation count.

* v1.8.1 of [lite-youtube](https://github.com/justinribeiro/lite-youtube) includes support for styling the play button via `::part` (thank you first time contributor [@Lukinoh](https://github.com/Lukinoh)!), and a minor fix for an odd Firefox position issue when using the image slot (thank you [@saiballo](https://github.com/saiballo) for bringing to my attention!).

* v3.0.0 of [code-block](https://github.com/justinribeiro/code-block) includes major version bump of [lit](https://lit.dev/) to v3.3.0 and minor revision of [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) to 1.30.0.

Still working to release a series of new open source projects, including my small hardware project for the [Polaroid SX-70 Flash Adapter](https://ribeiro.social/@justin/114434489667455579) and some new developer related tools for VS Code/Codium. Till next timeeeee!

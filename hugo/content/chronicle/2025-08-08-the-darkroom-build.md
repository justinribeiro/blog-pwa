I have setup a number of darkrooms over the years. There was the under-the-stairs darkroom I had in my San Francisco flat back in the early-2000's, really the first one I had used that was in a space I controlled; a bare bulb setup where I printed from glass plates primarily. There were the makeshift darkrooms in random bathrooms or laundry rooms in other apartments and houses as I moved around. There was the darkroom I built in my-also shop at the last house which I had a lot of fun in with the kids.

In practice, all these darkrooms worked but had the common trait of being temporary or shared amongst other activities. They always needed to be something else, for someone else—Dad get out of the bathroom!—which frankly is how one should live with others, least you not live with them anymore. That said, that also meant that they were never quite what I wanted from a working setup. I made compromises which were at times tolerable and other times not so much.

When we moved to the tiny farm, the outbuildings from the main house where all in some state of having been converted by previous owners to accessory dwelling units (ADU) to use the real estate vernacular. The garage had been converted into a grand room with green cabinets repainted white and a sink stuck in the corner of the room; this felt more like a Hampton Inn conference room than anything else. The original workshop attached to the garage—so labeled on the house plans from the late 1960's—had been converted into another room with a bathroom and shower which turned out to be a death trap of poor wiring and design. Building code's did not really make the list of considerations in these previous endeavors apparently.

On the plus side, there was running water, a water heater, and seemingly nothing but space for a darkroom. But where to put it?

## When Life Gives You Two by Fours, Build a Room

The problem with any build is you have constraints. Maybe it's space, most of the time it's budget, and I was very much in the later camp. As luck would have it, my brother-in-law rang one day with an offer of spare 2x4 boards and drywall left over from a remodel. I said sure, as well as taking a banged up pre-hung door.

After much tracing of wires, pipes, and beams, the south facing wall was our winner location.

Given the raw materials and placement need for my enlargers—Beseler 45MX and 23C II—I knew I didn't need or want a huge darkroom. I wanted to be able to sit-and-spin, from the enlarger to the trays behind me to work. So a small double bay setup seemingly appeared to be workable, with a clear dry and wet side. A common approach, one I never had in any of the other darkrooms I had built in the past.

I set to framing out the room.

The ceiling is the most overbuilt part of this room; I designed it support weight for storage. Why? Well, particularly for a few of my hanging backgrounds and lights, which are great except they are a pain to store. Not so anymore.

The dry wall I had was in what I would consider "used" condition and not quite all the same size, so what should have been hang and run sort of setup required a little bit more tap and mud on some places to hide the crimes than usual.

The beauty of course is, once you slap paint, base boards (spare matching baseboard at that, found in one of the sheds on the property) you can't tell.

While you will not mistake me for a carpenter, building a room of this type isn't exactly the most difficult thing to do. I had built other sort of rooms and structures and understood the how-to.

Now building a darkroom sink, that's new for me.

## To Build a Darkroom Sink

The conversation (or argument if you wish) you find around darkroom sinks is the age old question of whether to buy one pre-made or build one yourself. I readily admit, I inquired to a few friends and in few photography places to see if anyone had a spare sink they were willing to part with to save some time. The general answer, accompanied by a laugh in many cases, was no (at least here in Northern California).

Given that, I decided I would build one. The problem of course becomes out of what? My gut feeling was to opt for stainless steel, but that's expensive (and I'm cheap) and I don't have access to the size break I once did given the overall size (eight feet long by 30 inches wide).

Subsequently, I went for the other tried and true method: lumber and marine paint. This method has been around I presume forever as I've seen literally dozen of large darkroom sinks built this way. My twist on this was that I wanted a bottom metal pan. How to do that without a break? I give you the HVAC drip pan.

HVAC drip pans come in a lot of different sizes, from a lot of different people. You can buy the from McMaster-Carr, you can buy them locally, you can even get the odd version off of Amazon. The joy of them is that they are actually not terribly expensive, usually because they're galvanized steel. I spent around $75 USD for the version in the photo above which measures six feet by 28 inches by 2 inches. This is a more-than-workable size for the 16x20 trays I like to use, and gives me slightly more peace of mind than just a wooden bottom.

From a design standpoint, the total depth of the sink is just 5 inches and I added a track on the inside edge to be able to put plates in to use as additional flat table space should I need it.

Painting the sink is where patience comes into to play. First, you need a matched primer and paint, which for my application I used Rust-Oleum Marine Coatings Primer and Topside paint. I cannot stress enough that you have to match the primer to the material you are painting; Rust-Oleum sells different versions for different materials and sometimes that is not clear.

On the plus side, they did actually sell me both the primer and paint; some of their paint is hard to come by in California. This is oil-based paint, so preparation and ventilation is key. I applied two coats of primer with proper dry times in between before applying two coats of topside paint. I could have probably sped this painting work up given the quick dry times in the heat of an early California summer, but I find a good dry and scuff make all the difference.

With the paint done, I cut and fitted a hole for the inexpensive shower drain assembly.

Installing this sink was less fraught than expected. My tolerances and measures held well with just 1/8 inch spacing along the wall edges and beyond just the sheer weight-it is a lumber frame sink after all-the sink was in place and ready for plumbing.

## Plumbing Where There Are No Water Lines

I had stated earlier you will not mistake me for a carpenter; I am serviceable but I know my limits. Plumbing is a step beyond that: my limits are very very small. As such, I needed a clear plan as there are no pipes in these walls. No, not just in that location, in the building.

In an odd twist, how they converted this garage was to run _outside_ copper pipes along side the back of the building from the former workshop. Did they protect these pipes? No. Did they label which is hot or cold? No. Does it make sense? Sorta. They took a shortcut. We've all been there. It's just a creative way to go about it, given this building faces a wall of trees and the property line (ala, you can't see it). And the sink does work, as does the drain (which also runs along the outside of the building).

But again, I don't want to run 35 feet of copper to extend those lines. One, expensive. Two, did I mention expensive. No, I need some PEX and a water mix panel.

So I ran PEX with a copper tee off connection and popped the wall. I am not a plumbing expert, but PEX is pretty easy to handle. With some light EBay stalking, I eventually also settled on a good deal for a Delta Model 25 water temperature control panel.

## Ventilation Can Not Be Ignored

Having successfully put holes through the exterior wall, it was time to deal with the ventilation. I cannot properly elucidate the general stupidly of my youth when it came to this rule, mostly because those brain cells are gone. Because of the fumes.

As such, one should plan for not only for ventilation, but also the positioning of it. Most of the better darkroom build books point this out. The common that I too used was the bathroom/landry fan; when the fan is over your head, you're just dragging fumes across you face before finding their way out.

As such, I needed something that was more at the sink level. Justin, your back splash is too talk for that. Enter, ducts.

This design is to say, over powered. Most darkroom build guides will note that you only need 0.5 CFM change for each square foot. I oversized the inline fan to do around 6.0 CFM change per square foot, which requires 6 inch duct work. Smoke testing it, the fan drags from the sink basin with ease and not across my face, which is a marked win.

Did I need that much oomphf? No. Do I like it? Yes.

Of course you can't just put an exhaust fan in, you need an intake. I happened to have light tight air vents from previous darkroom endeavors, but it still hurt to cut a hole in a brand new wall.

## The Wet Side Has Come Together Nicely

Once the ventilation was in, a quick set of old shelves and the wet side has really come together.

Yes, there are some things still to sort. The quick connects on the hoses need to be install for the print washers—the 11x14 and the 20x24 you can see in the photo above. I didn't put the cabinet doors on the sink on, I am not a fan of doors honestly when I'm just trying to grab things. The main string of safelight LEDs is also not installed only my older Kodak. A few things to go, but the sink and setup is workable now which is a magical feeling.

## The Dry Side Could Use Some Love

Well, that's sort of a tongue-in-cheek comment. The enlargers are in working order, my policy is that when I move them around they have to be checked and realigned as needed (which I have not done yet). That, and I haven't hung the shelves and pulled all the paper out.

Overall however, the tolerances on that side have worked as planned; the tables fit snug to the wall with no space burned.

## Just the Start

Overall, I am very happy with how this darkroom build has come together. At 8 feet by 8 feet, the room has the spin around and develop style feel I like; you can spy a couple of vintage Brewer Entree medical stools in the photo below, which are quite lovely chairs in their own right. In terms of cost of materials, it's the most expensive darkroom I've ever built, spending just short of $1000 USD—$970.27 to be exact. However, if you're looking for a bill of materials to build out this style of darkroom, this is not that kind of build; my total is skewed given the large amount of materials I had on hand and re-used (e.g., I did not buy lumber, drywall, door, paint, fasteners, et cetera).

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that I haven't posted much as of late. This is more the likely due to the following reasons:

- The crew and I at Your Media Coverage have been blazing a trail of new short films and working on the big film. This includes four submissions to Current TV for the Toyota Yaris: <a href="http://www.current.tv/studio/media/5583784">Yaris: Street Racer</a>, <a href="http://current.tv/studio/media/5664489">Yaris: Stranded</a>, <a href="http://www.current.tv/studio/media/6231539">Yaris: Shoes</a>, and <a href="http://www.current.tv/studio/media/6231750">Yaris: Digging for oil</a>. If you haven't seen them, check them out. Then create an account and greenlight them if you feel compelled.
- A documentary film crew from NHK: Japanese Public Broadcasting liked the Toyota Yaris ads we did for Current so much, that they actually filmed us making the last two and interviewed me on camera for a documentary on this new form of advertising. Their documentary will be broadcast nationwide in Japan in mid-July.
- To top it off it's World Cup time, so I've been watching as many games as possible (that basically means all of them). I'm rooting for the USA to stop [blanking] around and play some football. Play with some heart guys!
- I am working on a couple start-up businesses with various recent grads from the MBA program. Gotta love the passion people put behind their work!
- It's summer time, which means the return of pleasant evenings for night photography. Stay tuned as I venture into new locations looking to gain new insight into light painting and making crazy night pictures with friends.

Alright, back to work for me.

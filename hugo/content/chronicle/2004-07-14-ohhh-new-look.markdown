I decided to redesign the website, and in the process clean up some things.  Hopefully everything is working, but I'll work out the kinks as I see them.


This look was inspired by many things, and including <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">zeldman.com</a>, <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">simplebits.com</a>, 
and <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">stopdesign.com</a>.  I tried with some success to match their slick usability, and for the most part, I'm happy with it.


The icons come from the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a> 1.4 series, which I'm still using as my daily desktop.  I love those icons.


Overall, I need to fix some redirects, but all should be well.

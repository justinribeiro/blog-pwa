It has been about 9 months since I moved from Seattle to San Francisco.  No regrets; they are at times very similar, and at other times not even close to the same (can you say less rain and 65 degree weather in March?).


Of course, leave it to me to miss out on the Mount St. Helens steam and ash show.  Yes, Seattle isn't that close.  But I would have done some driving to see and snap a few shots of that.  Of course, it did do this at 5:30pm, which means I would have sat in traffic for two hours, upon which it would then have been dark.  Basically, I have the same view in San Francisco as I would if I were living in Seattle. :-)

I largely consider July 1st as sort of a new year starting point.  Typically, the sun shines, I get bright ideas, and I start changing everything.  This year is no different; I've already secured my last Washington apartment for a short lease term.  I'm preparing for grad school, and my pending move back to California for said school.

To top it off, I've got a little bit of everything to finish in the mean time, so I'm cranking out the hours!

And now, for a short public service annoucement.  Remember, when creating explosives with fireworks, it is best to use them not to blow yourself up.  Happy 4th!  May the Texas-style BBQ be slow and sweet, and the chili ablaze!

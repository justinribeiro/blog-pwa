My buddy Fernando and his band <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=62176868">Bloomsday Rising</a> are releasing their debut CD _Rattling the Windows_ on Novemeber 17th in style.  They'll be playing at the <a href="http://www.rock-it-room.com/">Rock It Room</a> in San Francisco, are filming a music documentary at the same time, and it's going to be a rocking good time.  The album will also be available on iTunes.  From their blog:


<blockquote>So here's the deal: We are shooting a music documentary right now, so the gig will be a video event. If there ever were a time to grab a bunch of friends, put on your most pimped out and/or sexy Saturday night outfit, and dance your party-loving asses off to some great music.....well, this would be that time.</blockquote>

Tickets are just $5 in advance and $7 at the door.  The party begins at 8pm with drink specials.


I've liked their music for a while (I've seen them play quite a few times) and I still listen to the CD Fernando gave me in grad school.  If you haven't hear of them, I hope to see you at the Rock It Room on November 17th!

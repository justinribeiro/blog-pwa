Hot off my jQuery talk, I've got a couple of other talks in the queue.

1. [NFC Forum Spotlight for Developers, March 21st in San Francisco](http://nfc-forum.org/events/nfc-forum-spotlight-for-developers/). I'm a huge fan of NFC and have been for a while; it's such a great piece of technology. Google recently released a Chrome-NFC lib (see [https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-nfc](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-nfc)) and we're rapidly integrating that into our Chrome OS kiosk projects at Stickman, so things have been exciting on that front. I was asked to give a lightening talk and am coming up with something cool to do in 10 mintues. By the way, it's always cool when people ask you to speak. :-)

2. SPAR International, April 14 - 17th. My talk ["Beyond WebGL: Increasing Online Viewer Performance Pipeline on the Web and for Your Audience"](http://www.sparpointgroup.com/SPAR-International-2014-Presenters-Justin-Ribeiro/) is going to be action packed to say the least. I'm working up a couple demos, because I love a good demo. This isn't your normal I'm-loading-a-tiny-model-with-a-texture sort of talk, but I will cover the landscape in terms of what's going on in the open source community in terms of viewers. Beyond that, we're hitting on #perfmatters.

I have a couple other talks pending, so once I get them finalized I'll add them to the list. I hope to see you at one of the events!

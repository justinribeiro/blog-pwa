Had a couple visitors who have commented on my desk setup lately. It's not terribly special honestly, but it has evolved over the years.

My number one rule for desks is simple: the desk should be me. I keep pictures of my wife and kids, I have parts, old heatsinks as card holders, legos for device holding, and a hacked up hard drive I converted to a business card holder. The Japanese peace lily my wife bought me a couple years ago (a node to my love of the Corrneto Trilogy). It's odd bits and pieces and is usually a chaotic mess (I've removed the sensative bits in the attached photo), but works for me.

In a land of people who geneerally only work on laptops, I just can't do it. While I carry my hacked up Pixel, my daily driver is a workstation of fair power (6 core Haswell, 64GB RAM, a few SSDs); for me, it's just more flexible for the types of builds I do. I moved back to single monitor after years of a triple head setup in September and I'm happy with the change. The reason admitally is probably because I went big and run a 31 inch LG Digital Cinema display with unscaled 4K. The real estate is magic and I can't see pixels. Given my love of i3 on Linux, the size and resolution is really nice to use.

I still sit in the same bright green Herman Miller Embody that I've had for 3 years (worth every penny in my opinion, having sat in horrible, cheap, office chairs at other offices).

I've contemplated the standing desk (it's on my list to try out, but requires some additional planning).

I don't understand the need for desks to be hip; it's a desk, use it. Maybe I should take a picture of my workbench (which is a crazy story in and of itself). Maybe another day.

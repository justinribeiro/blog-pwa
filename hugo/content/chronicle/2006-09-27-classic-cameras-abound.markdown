I've been shooting a lot of pictures lately in between work and general film making activites.  It's no secret that I love working with my 300D, which offers a wonderful selection of great glass and a simple enough work flow.


Lately however, I've been out and about looking for old film cameras, something with a different look.  Most recently, a friend and I purchased a Polaroid 210 Land camera with flash for $3.  After a quick battery conversion and picking up some film packs, we were was off shooting.  The camera takes pretty decent pictures given that millions of them were made.


Then of course there are the three 126 format cameras purchased for another $3. A Kodak 104 Instamatic, Kodak X-15f, and a Keystone 725EF.  All cameras work fine (the Keystone required some work) and while 126 is hard to come by (Solaris makes 126 film carts) I look forward to putting them through the paces.


For $24 a friend and I picked up a Kodak Signet 30 and Kodak Signet 35.  Both cameras work great and we've been shooting with them the last week or so.


Film might be expensive, but sometimes shooting with the old stuff is just as fun.  Finding the old stuff at yard sales is even more fun!

April is wrapping up and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) was the hot topic this month at [GDG Oakdale](http://www.meetup.com/GDG-Oakdale/). James Duvall and I put a lot of work into the four events and in the process produced a fair amount of content for those out there who want to learn how to get started with Firebase on the web and on Android. Resources include:

1. [Firebase Overview slidedeck](https://goo.gl/bOVvZw)
2. [Firebase and the Web codelab @ Github](https://gdgoakdale.github.io/firebase-web-codelab-gdg-oakdale/)
3. [Firebase and Android codelab @ Github](https://gdgoakdale.github.io/firebase-android-codelab-gdg-oakdale/)

We got a signifcant amount of press and a big thank you goes out to Megan, Sarah, and everyone over at Firebase for their gracious help by sending over swag and tweeting to help drive developer interest.

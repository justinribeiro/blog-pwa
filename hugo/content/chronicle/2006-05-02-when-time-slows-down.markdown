title: When time slows down

I've always thought time often passes too fast.  When you're having fun, working hard, and generally busy, you can lose entire weeks only to stop and look back and wonder where the time went.  I'm not a fan of this because life seems to just pass me by, which is no fun at all.

Of course, the opposite is also true.  Time can crawl, the clock ticks backwards and the end never seems to come. Any student can probably think of a class they have taken like that or anyone who has been through the never ending meeting.

Why do I bring all of this up?  Because it is now the month of May, and I'm fairly close to wrapping this whole graduate MBA thing up.  Yet time seems to be expanding, the clock slowing, and my mind just full of so much information that I'm slowing down myself.  On the one hand, I'd like it to be over.  On the other I have a suspecting feeling I'll miss the debate, being around such creative people, and the level of difficulty that the degree brought forward.  The level of difficulty doesn't seem lost at the moment; my last few weeks should be nothing but non-stop difficulty.
  
I wouldn't have it any other way.  But I'd like just one opportunity to savor the moment, if I could just get that moment to slow down.  Maybe.  Just maybe.

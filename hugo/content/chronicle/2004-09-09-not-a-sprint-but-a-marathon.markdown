The pace has been rather brisk as of late.  The workload is continuing to push several of my side projects you guessed it, to the side.  I am however finding a new found love for sleep, which I'm finding to be in short supply of lately.


This is of course is no different from 90% of people.  Ask any parents out there with kids, any business startup with supply chain problems, anybody with no time.  There are many of us out there.


This isn't a complaint; rather I'm just thinking, musing if you will, that many times we sacrfice our own personal time for the goal of a greater good, a vision that maybe you can make things happen for other people.  Maybe it's for the kids, a friend, or your employees.


Just remember, life is not a sprint, but rather a marathon.  Remember that sometimes you need to pick up the pace, and other times slow it down.  Otherwise, you miss the race you're running (aka life events) and the finish line (aka the vision).

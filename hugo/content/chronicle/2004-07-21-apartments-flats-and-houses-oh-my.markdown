My continued search for an a place to live in San Francisco is going somewhat better.  I, along with my Mom (Thank you for helping me Mom!!!), searched high and low through expensive, and well expensive places.  Things apparently are a little more expensive in San Fran then I originally had hoped.  I knew better, but a guy can dream right?


When all was said and done, it however appears I do have a place to now live, at least when I head back to sign a lease on a two bedroom apartment near University of San Francisco on Friday.


Even at the advanced age of 24, I learned several things that I probably at one point knew, but forgot:



* Never make a left going east onto a street which is one way going west 
* Mom will always find better, cheaper places to live then I ever will :-)  


Thanks Mom!

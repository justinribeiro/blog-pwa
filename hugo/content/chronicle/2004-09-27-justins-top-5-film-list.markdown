After recently watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0146882/">High Fidelity</a>, it got me thinking about what some of my top 5 movie lists would look like.  So, in a new Monday column, a new top 5 movie list every week.  This weeks Top 5 list: Top 5 Films that I would stop what I'm doing to watch.



  * <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0081568/">The Stunt Man (1980)</a> - My all time #1 picture, this memorizing picture blurs the lines of reality and illusion into a simply mind boggoling film.  Richard Rush directs a stellar cast (Peter O'Toole is beyond exceptional in this film) and really just messes with your head.  Thank you Michael (who saw the original opening in Seattle) for getting me a the new DVD set.

  <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0047396/">Rear Window (1952)</a> - My favorite Alfred Hitchcock film.  The movie interesting single perscpective from the apartment window of James Stewart, and stellar acting all the way around make it a masterpiece of film.


*
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0049730/">The Searchers (1956)</a> - John Ford is considered by many to be the best director of all-time (even Orson Welles considered him the best), and this film simply captures that.  One of his best films, this movie just sucks me in every time.  One of John Wayne's best films in my opinion.


* <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0057012/">Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)</a> - How Stanley Kubrick ever made this film when he did, I'll never really know.  The film is so pointed and funny ("You can't fight in here! This is the War Room!") in a time when many people though that the USSR and USA would destory the world, just make you think.  The performances in the film are extreme and wonderful; as the movie goes on, you just see how crazy everyone actaully is.

*
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0064115/">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)</a> - Newman and Redford play well off each other in this film.  Director George Roy Hill made a very interesting anti-hero picture, that as they're near the end, you really want them to come out alright (in layman's terms).  The last scene has to be one of the best ever, the complete opposite of say Bonnie and Clyde (1967).




It's difficult to pick only five films.  Others I considered included Bonnie and Clyde, High Noon, The Last Picture Show, Cool Hand Luke, Mister Roberts, The Apartment, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and the Indian Jones movies.


So many good films, so few slots!  Come back next Monday when I tackle the next Top 5 film list!

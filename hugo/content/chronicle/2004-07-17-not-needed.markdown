Note: do not send newsletter emails to everyone you know, proclaiming "I went to buy bread, and almost ordered in French".  No one cares that you were out of the country.

Justin's Note: This is a joke that one of my friends explained to me about an email he received.  It's not a great joke, nor is it worth telling.  I just though it had the odd punch line.


Justin's Note II:  This is such a completely pointless post I'm tempted to delete it.  I mean, what was I thinking when I posted this?  Peer pressure, that has got to be it.

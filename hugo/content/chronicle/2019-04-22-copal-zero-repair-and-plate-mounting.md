I've never been one to shy away from trying to fix something I don't fully understand. There's a joy of slowing down and reading exploded views or listening to someone explain the inner workings of a fine working thing.

When the opportunity came up to buy a broken Copal 0 shutter, it's aperture in shambles, I jumped at the opprtunity. I had worked on cameras before, but I never torn down a Copal shutter (my large format lens shutters have all held up, knock on wood).

Some documentation exists online, notably the [Compur shutter repair guide](http://www.suaudeau.eu/memo/rep/Compur-shutter-repair-manual.html) which shows various exploded views for certain types of Compurs. Along with those diagrams, the [Fix Old Cameras](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_LLC4wtg7fORCFtw97xhDg) has an [excellent tear-down video from 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0aPioTs6hM) that walks through the various steps.

Armed with some basic knowledge, I broke out the tools and started tearing the shutter apart. Each layer into a container, every screw marked. The end result being my own real life exploded shutter.

The putting back together part was interesting. A slow process of alignment for the aperture was time consuming, the shutter less so. The light touch required for either was nonetheless fun, a test of dexterity.

All in all, I was able to get the shutter back together. Not only that the shutter was back up and running.

Given the research and time I took studying the various parts after I tore it down, it took me the last half a of a Thursday evening which is not too bad in my opinion.

The task of what to do with the shutter then became the next issue. I didn't have any spare lensboards lying around and I wanted to mount it onto my Crown Graphic made more difficult given the lip edge that those boards. Luckily, there exists an [excellent existing 3D model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:797723) to save me a step.

With some polycarbonate loaded up, I printed a strong but much too shiny lensboard.

Nothing a little some high grit sandpaper and some ultra matte paint can't handle.

The end result, fitted with a repaired Copal 0 and 150mm/5.6 Fuji element on that Crown Graphic is ready for a round out in the field.

Looking forward to picking up and fixing more old shutters. Now time to work through the camera backlog.

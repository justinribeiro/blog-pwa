Today, I finalized my new lease for a two bedroom flat in San Francisco.  For those who are interested to know, a flat is an like a piece of a house, with a private entrance.  I do like the place quite a bit, and got a very good deal on the lease.


The flat is located on Lone Mountain, just behind University of San Francisco off of Anza.  I'm not moving in until August, but am looking foward to the new adventure that will be San Francisco.

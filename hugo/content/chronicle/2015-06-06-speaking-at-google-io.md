May was a busy month though you wouldn't know it from looking over my online social activity. Pretty quiet on the Google+ and Twitter, not a lot of tickets or commits on Github. Not even a post on this blog. Generally, a whisper sort of silence.

The main reason was because I was due to speak at [Google I/O](https://events.google.com/io2015/schedule?sid=654889d1-cbf5-e411-b87f-00155d5066d7#day2/654889d1-cbf5-e411-b87f-00155d5066d7) on Polymer and Firebase. I was practicing. And writing. And coding. And revising. And more practicing. And rehersals. And all kinds of things.

I couldn't say anything at the time (the schedule had not landed), but I was busy to say the least. :-) In the end, my talk went pretty well. I had a packed house and huge thank you to all that came out (cheers to my fellow GDE in Wearables Allen Firstenberg for the photo):

The slides for my talk aren't public yet (but should be in short order) and a few people recorded the talk (so I suspect it'll find itself online as well).

I want to give a huge thank you to Google for the opportunity as well as a lot of people who helped make this happen: Ola Krainska and the GDE team, Rob Dobson and the Polymer team, Frank van Puffelen and the Firebase team and a ton of people I can't list here. Thank you all for the assitance, reviews, and taking the time to make sure this was fine tuned.

A huge shout out to my fellow Google Developer Experts for all the support (you all rock!), Erik Isaksen, James Cha, James Duvall, Mica Simonian, and Ahsen Baig for staking out the sandbox and cheering me on.

And thank you to my wife Monica, who consitently reminded me to breathe (which, even though I've given hundreds of talks over the years, nothing quite like this one took my breathe away so quickly :-).

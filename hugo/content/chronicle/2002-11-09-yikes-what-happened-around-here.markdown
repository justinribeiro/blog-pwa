Yes, I've made more changes.  I completely tweaked out the galleries page to look more like linuxart.com, which I though looked cool.  I had to write a large piece of code, and rip some stuff out, but all in all, it works pretty well.  I also changed the style sheet back to the orignal way it was, with san serif font being the primary instead of arial.  Arial was just driving me crazy.  Doesn't look very clean on some monitors.

Also, all the pages except the galleries page now meet XHTML 1.0 Strict!  The CSS also meets spec.

Otherwise, lets see what else I can break around here...

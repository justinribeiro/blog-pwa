Christmas has come and gone, and New Year's is fast approaching.  Things should be slowing down some would say, but in fact I'm just getting warmed up:




* Filming on my new film "The Gift" has wrapped.  We are in the post production process and will be finished cutting the five minute short probably by the end of the week.

* I'm finally going to get a few spare moments to process the loads of pictures I've taken the last few months, starting with the newest.  Some of the galleries are aleady online in the Photography section.

* The new business plan is really starting to take shape.  I'm looking forward to submitting it for the many MBA competitions this spring.



There's simply nothing like being busy.  At least it's a good kind of busy.  No, not that kind.  The other kind, when you accomplish goals.

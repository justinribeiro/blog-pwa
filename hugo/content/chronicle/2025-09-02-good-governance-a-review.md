> An ongoing publishing of the papers, memo's, and explorations I wrote in various Doctoral and PhD Seminars between 2021 and 2024. This memo dates from October 2022.

I am not a marine biologist. This statement cannot be overemphasized, the extent to which I understand the science of complex ocean ecosystems is captured while sitting on the couch and watching a documentary in which David Attenborough speaks where I begin nodding quizzically while murmuring “I could do that”. My confused wife—an actual wildlife biologist—puzzled by this asks, “Which part? The voiceover part?”, to which I say “No, the boat part on the sea with the science. I could do that.”

Her laughter echoes in the halls of our home to this day.

While I may not be a marine biologist, this does not portend that I cannot research the nature of measuring good governance when it comes to complex natural ecosystems on which people and their communities depend. To do so, I’ve looked to understand measuring good governance in the literature through the lens of coral reef-dependent communities within the Caribbean. From this lens, we’re going to explore three primary areas in this paper: 1) the article’s aim and argument, 2) the complexity of good governance, its various stages, and the struggle for measurement, 3) an assessment of the discoveries around perception of those measures and their effectiveness.

The article at the center of analysis, “Measuring good governance for complex ecosystems: Perceptions of coral reef dependent communities in the Caribbean” from Turner et al in 2015. The paper’s main aim is to measure community perceptions of existing established good governance principles across the region and ultimately assess and identify underlying themes driving the perceptions of the relationship with those governance structures. Conceptually, the main argument is that measuring only the outcomes of applied governance principles at a nation scale provides an incomplete story to the overall effectiveness of governance; that an assessment of governance processes and structures that include more additional contexts—local communities and their perceptions of the applied principles—are critical to understand the combinations of variables that create positive and negative outcomes.

Measuring this concept is incredibly important, yet vastly complex. The authors note early in the paper that “though the correspondence between good governance and good outcomes is an active area of research, this relationship is complex and remains largely undefined.” (P2). Given the large number of frameworks that specifically inform natural resource governance, the article broadly defines three broader categories: 1) substantial principles (e.g., efficiency, equity, sustainability) which direct the development of governance goals and outcomes, 2) procedural principles (e.g., rules, norms, values) which guide decision-making processes, 3) structural characteristics of institutional arrangements.

While this flow makes the process seem simple, the measurement of only outcomes results in considerable time lag between governance process and outcome. Such a flow ignores the complexity of actions taken by governance, which could be measured as early stage indicators before outcomes, resulting in the means to close the gap on weaknesses and be proactive. This also ignores that governance structures potentially ignore the uncertainty of application within communities, which could lead to failed outcomes.

To box this complexity into a researchable unit, the article defines its scope with seven governance principles and performance outcomes, largely from Lockwoods 2010 paper, “Good governance for terrestrial protected areas: A framework, principles and performance outcomes”: legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, connectivity, and resilience. A similar approach is taken with institution structure indicators: local government organization, Active local NGO, Resource user organization, access to information from reef management network, level of co-management. The quantitative approach this study took was to conduct face-to-face semi-structured interviews with targeted questions per principle, and then use multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to identify dimensions of variations in the dataset (though I will note that this explanation is my simplification of the overall approach, which would be a paper in and of itself). While not dismissing the challenge to create such a dataset, there are nonetheless specific tradeoffs and challenges in the approach.

From an institution structure perspective, because the study focuses on four different countries the need to explore different organization and community actors is one born out of complexity. While governance in the region is critical, there are many actors involved at many different levels, “from local level community-based organizations to government departments and international bodies” (p. 4) which the study attempts to cluster based on respondent answers and information-sharing to attempt to construct perceived reality of the governance in use. From a principles perspective, the limitation is that there was a struggle to capture individual experience with governance processes and different preferences among community members. This is qualitative collection—perceptions of people—meshed into the set of qualitative dimensions and suffers from difficulty in evaluating governance interactions within a singular process in space, given that multiple governance processes and actors can interact at different spatial and temporal scales (p. 13). Taking these both sets of challenge into account the study acknowledges that the “perceptions of principles also varied independently of structural arrangements highlights that governance is an uncertain endeavor” (p. 14).

Frankly, I struggle with this study beyond the challenges denoted above. While I do not doubt the veracity of the approach or data or that the study succeeded in its aim, I do not find that the result is generalizable. The very last line of the paper, “These insights have important implications for the design of successful management systems and governance structures for sustainable resource use” I firmly call into question. Yes, the perceptions of people on the way their natural resources are governed is important but also inherently mercurial; it’s a snapshot in time, of people in a region for a particular resource. The discoveries of important themes such as institutional acceptance and engagement on the surface sound generalizable to governance in other natural resource cases but are they really? Would the resultant conceptual model and measurement of perceived effectiveness of governance in the article render similar results in different circumstances, in more complex regions, with more diverse actors? No; I believe that the complex nature of the variables, with their interdependence and side-effects would be troublesome to approach in other governance scenarios.

I would be remiss to not acknowledge that however much I disagree with the generality of the study that its aim like so many others is to tell a compelling story around “good governance”. The phrase is largely not definable; talk to different people, read different studies and the phrase becomes a misshapen set of legal, organization, and nation-state to-dos and Christmas lists, a wishful “good” that seeks measurement but can be ever elusive. Surprisingly to me, this makes the study all the more compelling within the context it defines; it tries and succeeds not in its generality but in its measure of an important set of governance that has true consequences for the ecosystem that needs support. Support from data that can create action within the community and broaden the conversation in ancillary natural resource management. The very usefulness of this endeavor cannot be overstated; while measurement may be difficult for governance principles and the interplay of indicators as to their effectiveness before the final outcome is known, to not measure—rather, to not look at the problem square in the face—is to summarily produce an ecosystem's demise.

I may not be a marine biologist. I may not be a governance scholar. I am moved all the same to see the importance and usefulness of measuring governance, regardless of the complex nature of the endeavor.

Building Chrome Extensions is not as difficult as most people presume and can be quite useful when you need to extend Chrome to do just a little bit more than.

To that end, I wrote up a codelab that we ran this week at GDG Oakdale with 25 people that builds a basic Github issue list using Chrome.* APIs and the Github v3 API. The feedback was great and after some slight updates, it's now fully up for general public use:

* [Instructions and steps](https://justinribeiro.github.io/chrome-extensions-codelab-gdg-oakdale/)
* [Source Code](https://github.com/justinribeiro/chrome-extensions-codelab-gdg-oakdale)

If you want a version without the GDG Oakdale mentions for use at your school or user group, I've also pushed a clean version to [GoogleDeveloperExperts](https://github.com/GoogleDeveloperExperts) Github account:

* [Instructions and steps](https://googledeveloperexperts.github.io/issue-viewer-chrome-extension-codelab)
* [Source Code](https://github.com/GoogleDeveloperExperts/issue-viewer-chrome-extension-codelab)

Many thanks to fellow Google Developer Expert [Konrad Dzwinel](https://plus.google.com/+KonradDzwinel/posts); we talked this codelab through during his Chrome extension workshop at the GDE Summit in November and the steps are based on his excellent approach.

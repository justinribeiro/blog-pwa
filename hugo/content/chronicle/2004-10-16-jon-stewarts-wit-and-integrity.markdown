I happened to see a lot of discussion around the 'Net today on Jon Stewart appearing on CNN's Crossfire news show last night.  I'm not a fan of Crossfire, mostly for the same reason Jon isn't; it poses as serious debate, but is nothing more then an black eye on journalism.  I decided to download the episode from a <a href="http://bitflood.org:8080/?file=791b2f5d95a54d1381b85f271b51f71e73964185">BitTorrent site</a>, and see what all the fuss was about.


I'm left speechless.  Jon Stewart simply crushed the two hosts of this show.  They tried to make fun of him, hold him to some higher standard, and he just crushed them.  His plea for better journalism went unanswered; the hosts were simply outclassed and had no response to his questions.


I say two thumbs up for Jon Stewart for standing up for little guys who just want the facts.

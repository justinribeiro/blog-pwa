It has become apparent to me that everyone I know is getting married in August.  I have four weddings in the span of three weeks in August, spanning from California to Washington.  So far, I'm in two of the weddings.  This means two different tux fittings, with wildly different tux colors from my understanding (full white tux, and a more typical black tux). I'm a very hands off guy; what ever the bride wants, I'm more then accommodating .


Needless to say, this means I've been gearing up to improve my wedding photography. The few weddings I've actually focused on taking pictures, have turned out suprisingly well but left me still desiring more.  I've been reading the <a href="http://www.photo.net/community/forums">photo.net forums</a> as well as other wedding photography articles (<a href="http://www.ultimatewedding.com/articles/get.php?action=getarticle&articleid=531">Article 1</a> and <a href="http://www.ofoto.com/PhotoTipsWedding.jsp">Article 2</a>) and am looking into a couple different books. I figure with four weddings, I'm bound to get one or two good shots out of the 1000 or so photos I hope to take.


I'm debating about renting a Canon 10D for the job and still taking my older Epson 3100z. It depends I guess; I haven't used the 10D before, so I'll have to rent it to at least get a feel for it before I actually go the weddings.  Not to mention, I'm in two of the weddings, and I can't see myself with carrying either camera size-wise.  As you can see, I'm still working out the details.

Make no mistake, I like digital photography.  My Canon 300D is often in use and takes wonderful pictures.  But sometimes you just yearn for a little different look, a little different creative process.  Hence, film.

So I've been gathering a fair amount of film developing material.  Chemistry, containers, stainless steel tanks and reels, all kinds of stuff.  All this to develop 135, 120 and even 620 film I bought off Ebay that were 30 years old.  Needless to say, the film development has been not only easy, but pretty fun as well.

On the print side, I actually made contact prints of 4x5 glass negatives using nothing more then a darkroom and a light bulb.  The results were amazingly good considering I was a little short on the equipment and experience.

Say what you want...but developing film and prints using nothing but a bunch of second hand parts and good 'ol chemistry can still be fun.

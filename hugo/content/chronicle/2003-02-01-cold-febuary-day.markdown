John Wayne once said "Courage is being scared to death... and saddling up anyway."  The crew of the Colombia did just that.  Saddling a rocket and riding her 'till she bucked.  Seven souls with courage that most people won't ever begin to approach myself included.

God be with them, and prayers to the families and friends that they leave behind.

Such a cold day today.  Just bites at you.

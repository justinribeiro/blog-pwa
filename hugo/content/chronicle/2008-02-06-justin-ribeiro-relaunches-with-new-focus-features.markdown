<p align="left">After a few months, I am happy to finally launch the newest version of JustinRibeiro.com.  The site has been on the back burner for some time, as other projects have taken priority.  However, after putting the final touches on my Wordpress hacking I'm happy to finally allow this new version out the door.

<p align="left">Some new features and changes the site contains:



	* Now powered by Wordpress.  I did a heavy customization, using the codex as my guide.  Surprisingly easier than I expected.  The site design is a take on <a href="http://mezzoblue.com/">MezzoBlue</a>, with some elements from my think tank <a href="http://j5studios.com">J5 Studios</a>, and some of my techniques that I used on <a href="http://www.demodayfinder.com">golf demo days site DemoDayFinder.com</a>. 
	* I've started integrating feeds into the site using <a href="http://simplepie.org/">SimplePie</a>.  You can keep up to date with my Google Reader shared stories and my del.icio.us shared links. 
	* My dashboard is being powered by <a href="http://twitter.com/justinribeiro/">Twitter</a>, so if you want up-to-date action on your cell phone or just want to follow on Twitter, you can find me there as well. 
	* Comments are now enabled and use <a href="http://site.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, which allows your gravatar, or globally__ __recognized avatar, to appear next to your comment.  I definitely recommend you sign-up if you already haven't. 
	* The main RSS feed is now powered by <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home">Feedburner</a>. 
	* I've removed the resume page.  If you would like my current resume, please just ask. 

<p align="left">What you can expect in the future:



	* My goal is to move most of my original chronicle entries from J5 Studios over to my new Wordpress system. 
	*  I expect to break out the articles into their own category feeds, such as Business, Technology, Photography and Personal. 
	* I'm not planning on moving any of the projects off of J5 Studios 
	* The photography galleries on J5 Studios will remain, but Monica and I are in the implementation stages of opening a new photography gallery with purchase options, so stay tuned 

<p align="left">I hope everyone enjoys the new JustinRibeiro.com, and that we can start a new conversation here.

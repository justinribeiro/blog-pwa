Been a very busy week.  Lots of things going on, so lets just get right to it.

I recently wrote my ORIGINAL-based gallery page in OOP PHP.  ORIGINAL was already written in OOP for the most part, but my hacked up version of it was not.  So, I had a moment this week, and I rewrote my hacked piece.  It works a lot better now, and I can actually tell what I was trying to do in the first place.

I'd also like to extend my thanks to Luca De Rugeriis for the Italian translation of Escputil GTK Perl FrontEnd that I wrote.  Very cool!  I'd also like to thank Luca for helping me solve my own little Gimp-print problem.  Solving this problem, however made me realize that the printer head alignment in my frontend needs to be fixed.  (I didn't get any angry email about it, so I take it no one used it.)  Hope to have it fixed next week.

I also received news from my good buddy Duvy that he has finished cutting our short film for Your Media Coverage.  He'll soon be making a copy for me on DVD (lucky bastard with the new DVD burner!) and it'll make the web page soon.  An actual script is currently in the works for the next version too.

My mentor owns <a href="http://www.chezjane.com/">http://www.chezjane.com/</a> a small specialty food company.  I usually don't do product endorsements, but damn, I love that garlic spread!

Many people are probably here to view the latest project I have on the books: <a href="http://www.j5studios.com/projects/excel/">Microsoft Excel Macro's for results and formulas</a>.  Let me welcome you...Hello!


The project stems out of the need to print both numbers and formulas for Excel models on the same page, a function which Excel currently does not have.  Why would I need to do this?  Because I'm taking an MBA class that deals with decision making and modeling with Excel (MBA 612 with Professor Grossman) at the University of San Francisco.  Many people in the class voiced an opinion that this migh be nice to have.  So, I hacked something together.


As usual, everything is GPL'ed, so you can take the code and hack to your hearts delight, though I'd love to hear if you find a better way or have any improvments.

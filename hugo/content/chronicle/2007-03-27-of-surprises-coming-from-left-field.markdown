A funny thing happened on Sunday that I did not expect; my girlfriend Monica and friend Rebecca secretly setup a surprise birthday party for me.  I was completely shocked and apparently nearly all of my family and friends back home were in on the ploy.  It was shocking to say the least given it was a week before my birthday.  They caught me off guard.


It was a small gathering, but it meant a lot to me.  The little kids got to run around and play, and the adults pretty much did the same.  There was a piÃƒ±ata in the shape of a movie camera which the kids wacked away at.  Apparently I also had to take my swings as the birthday boy, as I was blindfolded and laughed at for being a dork as I couldn't hit the side of a barn.  By the way, Katie, I want those pictures before they spread. :-)


It's no secret that I'm not big on my birthday; I've been known to be unavailable the day of my birthday.  But this year, I was blindsided.  And I have to say, it was wonderful.


The story isn't for me to tell, as they tell it better then I can.  But apparently I was close to stumbling on the plot several times by shear coincidence. I wanted to say thank you to the family and friends who could attend, and a special wink to those who had to make things up to keep me in the dark.  Those people include my Mom, who was hiding supplies and had to keep me out of the house, Josh who kept me unknowingly busy the day of the party as we shoot B-roll for a new film, and Monica and Rebecca who were just plain sneaky for setting the whole thing up and going to all the trouble.


Thank you!  Just remember, I can be sneaky too and you all should watch out as your birthday's draw near. ;-)

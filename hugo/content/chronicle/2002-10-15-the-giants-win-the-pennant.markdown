What can I say?  I'm a Giants fan.  I've been one since I was a kid.  Will Clark was my hero, and he still is.  Sure, the team is a little different now, with big name guys like Mr. Bonds and Mr. Kent.

But when it comes down to the clutch, all I've got to say is David Bell.  I love him!  Quiet, plays hard, and gets the job done.  Most underrated player on the team right now.

They're playing good ball, but its a hard road ahead against that rally monkey and those Angels.  Some people are going to tell you it's going to be a push over series.  Let me tell you, they don't know baseball.  It's going to match up to be a good one, and I can't wait.
Here's to hoping of no repeat of '89 (earthquake included).

I just received the very good news from my dear friend Jessah that she has been accepted into the Berkeley graduate program where she'll be studying Public Policy.  

Congratulations are due to this very smart lady, who told me when we first met that she wanted to attend graduate school there. That was over six years ago, and her dream has rightly come true.  I wish her the best of luck when she starts in fall, and let me be the first to say welcome to California (we get more sun then Olympia)!

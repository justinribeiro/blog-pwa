I recently purchased a deck of <a href="http://kem-cards.com/">Kem cards</a> which I'm finding to be very nice.  For those who don't know, they're a type of plastic card that doesn't crease or dog-ear.  They're not cheap, but are supposed to last a long time (aka years) if cared for.  You can even even wash them.


I bought them mostly because I was tired of buying deck after deck of cards after weekend games.  After a test run of games last night, I'm pleased to say, they hold up well.  They were tossed, bent, rolled...and they always return flat.  It looks as if they weren't even used.  Wiped them off with a damp cloth, and bam, just like new.


I'm no card expert, but I've got to say, it was money well spent.

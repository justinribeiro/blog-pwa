It's not secret that I like photography.  It's the little side hobby I do when I have but the briefest moments of time. Recently, I've been branching out into new areas of photography.  You might even call it old.

I've been recently shooting old film (pre-1970 expiration date) in old cameras (such as a Rolleicord Ia and Ansco Rediflex).  How are the results?  So far I haven't developed the film as of yet; my darkroom supplies are on the way to do so, since I want absolute control over these negatives.  But I find working with older cameras a mysterious and very fun time.

I know what some people will say.  Film? Development?  Digital is so much easier.  It might be.  But give someone an old Imperial Debonair loaded with 620 film (think 120 size but on smaller diameter spools) and they love it.  I know this from experience; my friend just took the Debonair for a spin and had a blast.  Simple box style cameras, 6x6 negatives, frame it and shoot.  But with style!

How many of the older cameras have I picked up with my camera partner Monica?  At current count we've picked up 20 different cameras from garage sales, estate sales and pretty much anywhere that has a dusty corner.  Our general rule of thumb when buying older cameras is that if it works and it's under $10, then it's coming home.  There are exceptions for things like the Rolleicord ($30) or a camera I think I can fix (low serial Kodak 35).

Needless to say, I'll have a slew of new photographs from a variety of cameras in the next month.  It should be a blast!

While not a secret, I haven't spoken much on working with Project Tango. A lot of the code I've worked in the last three months is still pretty raw, but exciting nonetheless. That excitment lead to a couple of talks this month to get people excited about developing for the platform; one at GDG Oakdale and one at GDG Fresno.

A copy of the slides are available: [https://goo.gl/chTreG](https://goo.gl/chTreG)

Many thanks to Larry Yang and the team from Project Tango for the correction on slide 32 (more eyes always better!). A shout out to Pacific mentor, GDG Fresno co-organizer, and all around good guy James Cha for inviting me to Fresno (great seeing everyone...DevFest 2015 is going to rock!).

Reading time, two minutes.

* Tree House, Part 2: This is one of those projects that is nearing completion.  We had hoped to complete it in May, and got a little side tracked.  We're working on it.
* idlemailcheck: the newest versions of Mail::IMAPClient have some changes that make checking dealing with the idle socket much easier.  I'm working an updated version.
* Film reviews: we've been shooting a lot of film of late, and I just haven't been able to put thoughts to keyboard. I will say now, I actually like the new PX 100 Silver Shade (opinion seems fairly split on it).
* World Cup goalkeeping:  oh, I've got thoughts and notes galore.  First note: stop blaming the ball.  Other notes to follow.
* Android development: yes, I'm doing some Android development.  I like it.  I also like the Nexus One, which I'm using a dev phone.
* No, I'm not upgrading to iOS4: my 3G is still in use...but why would I cripple it with iOS4?  A jailbreak is better.
* <a href="http://justinribeiro.com/chronicle/2010/06/23/the-lowdown-on-yard-and-estate-sales/">Rocking the estate and yard sale circuit</a>.  How do you think I score those deals to build cool stuff?
* <a href="http://justinribeiro.com/chronicle/2010/06/23/notes-on-being-a-consultant-ala-you-don%E2%80%99t-want-to-be-one/">I warn of consulting</a>.  Or at least the use of the word.

So much awesome stuff in the pipe, I just can't work fast enough!

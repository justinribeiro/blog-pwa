I decided to give the 'ol page a new look.  It's not very drastic, given that the format of the page didn't change. I simply gave it a color makeover.  The beauty of CSS and XHTML is that I only had to edit a couple files, and the look flowed down through the entire site.


The new top logo is actually a piece of a picture I took of my dad's Ford 7600 tractor; as you can tell the tractor has seen its share of work.


As always, the site continues to be a work in progress.  I'll probably continue tweaking for the next couple of days as I see fit (aka in case I find bugs :-).

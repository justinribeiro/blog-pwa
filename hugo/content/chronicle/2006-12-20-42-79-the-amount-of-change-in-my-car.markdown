Yes, you read that right. $42.79. If you want to get specific, the breakdown was $27.75 in quarters, $10.10 in dimes, $2.75 in nickels, and $2.19 in pennies.

I typically keep change in my car for the meters in San Francisco (which are not cheap by the way).  The change usually piles up over the course of a year, through purchase and what not. Sometime at the end of the year (such as yesterday) I take out all the change and cash it in, leaving me to start all over again.

Yes, pretty odd posting isn't it?  :-)  Happy Holiday's everyone!

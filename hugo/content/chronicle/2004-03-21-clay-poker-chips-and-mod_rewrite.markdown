The title is somewhat misleading; neither has anything to do with the other, but hey, I like adding a little mystery to my titles.  



I'm in the market for clay poker chips, which I find is much harder then it seems to actually find.  Lots of people seem to be selling 11.5 gram "slug" chips, which are just plastic, or composite resin which has a metal slug in them for weight.  That's fine I guess, but I want clay casino chips.  Needless to say, I have found them at some places, but the cost is quite high.  Custom printing, hot stamping, and everything else, you end up a a dollar a chip.  Too much money for me...



I then turned to the forums over at <a href="http://www.texasholdem-poker.com/forum/phpbb/phpBB2/index.php">TexasHoldem-Poker.com</a> for help.  The forum users had lots of first had experience with my problem, and lots of valid links (of which I will not list here) that I found helpful.  My hunt was fruitful; I found some cheap clay composites for about $0.10 a chip (9 gram super diamonds which I've used in card rooms before).  Not fancy, but I don't need fancy. 



Mod_rewrite has given me a lot of trouble this weekend, of which is mostly a configuration issue I believe.  Anyhow, I changed the news and photography gallery again to reflect nice an easy links instead of the variable string jumble that it was.  Clean, effective, and very slick.

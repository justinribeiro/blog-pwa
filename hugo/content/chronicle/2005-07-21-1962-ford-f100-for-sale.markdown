We have decided to sell our 1962 Ford F100 pickup truck.  I'll be placing it on Ebay in the next couple of days (I will update this post with said auction link), but if anyone wants to look at the truck before hand, I've placed the images in the <a href="photography/index.php/2005_07_21__1962_Ford_F100">Photography</a> section.


The truck was used as a farm truck for a long time, but my Dad haven't used in the last couple years.  It's painted in primer gray and has some rust.  It's a step-side body style, with original decals.  It has a 223 cubic inch straight-6 pushing 137 horsepower, a 3-speed transmission on the column ("three on the tree"), a Holly carburetor and a very nice interior.  It has a crack in the windshield, and toolbox in the pickup bed.  The truck has not been licensed for some time (non-operational).


It would make a great fixer-upper; while it's not running now, new points and a battery should get it running in no time flat (I may do that this weekend as a matter of fact, because it is a fun truck to drive).


<b>UPDATE:</b> The truck is now listed on Ebay: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=4564130399&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&rd=1">1962 Ford F-100 StepSide</a>.  Happy bidding!


<b>UPDATE:</b> Sold!  The truck has been sold on Ebay for $385 US to a nice guy out in New Zealand.  The bidding was fierce up until the end, and thank you to all those that bid!

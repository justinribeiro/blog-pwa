In case you didn't see the news over at the <a href="http://www.demodayfinder.com/blog/">DemoDayFinder.com Blog</a>, I'll be one of the reporters (and our photographer) covering the <a href="http://www.pgashow.com/">2008 PGA Merchandise Show</a> in Orlando, Florida in January.  We received our media credential approvals last week, and are gearing up to provide the best coverage possible.  It's an exciting time as it's an invitation only event for PGA members.  We're going to be doing some heavy coverage of the event with all the new golf gear, so expect to see our stuff not only on the site, but on the wire.

I've been working heavily.  It's what I do the most, and at times, the best.

I'm going crazy. Looking for a nice small town, ala-Stuckeyville/Stars Hollow/Everwood/Smallville or a nice combination of all, to run a store, and live in peace.  Willing to pay top dollar for bowling alley or cafe. Serious offers only.

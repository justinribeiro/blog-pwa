<a href="http://www.demodayfinder.com/">DemoDayFinder.com</a> is the latest project I've been working to complete.  The site helps golfers find the latest equipment demo days from golf manufacturers, which previously was a difficult job since this information wasn't available in one location. It utilizes a number of cool technologies, including Google Maps, Google Calendar, and jQuery.


It's been a joint venture between myself, Gareth Coen and my brother Jim.  We formed <a href="http://www.stickmanventures.com/">Stickman Ventures, Ltd</a> to manage the site as well as pursue other projects.  We expect this to be the first of many.


Our major goal at the moment is to get golf manufacturers on board with the concept of sending us their dates, as it makes it easier for golfers and us to stay up to date.  We've also started on the next round of features, which should add more fun and usability to the site.

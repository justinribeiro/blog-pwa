I've finally finished with my finals, and have shifted focus to a few odds and ends as I work towards production of my crew's feature film this summer.

<b>Odd End #1</b>:  I've purchased a Treo 650.  Yes, it was a natural progression from the Palm V->Palm m515->Treo 650, not to mention I sort of broke my other phone. I decided that it would be beneficial from a work perspective to have email on the go, and while I could have went Blackberry (very popular among the MBA community I might add), I went with a Palm device, because they have always just worked for me.  The Treo 650 is about the same, but has its bugs; the web browser is lackluster and often resets the device, but other then that, a very useful device.  SnapperMail is a must have, along with the fontsmoother application.  It has gotten me into thinking of writing a few hacks for it.

<b>Odd End #2</b>: Hacking the Zenith XBV343.  So, a few years ago I purchased for my folks a DVD/VHS player, the Zenith XBV343.  It's a very nice player, good feature set and has always worked.  However, low and behold, I go to place a VCD of some selected scenes that the crew and I had put together last night, and it doesn't work.  Search on Google and bam! One VCD hack coming right up.  Below is the hack reprinted from <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks.php?select=Zenith+XBV343">VideoHelp.com</a>:


    * Using remote with no disc in player
    * Turn on power, wait until "disc" appears on display. Press "pause"
    * Enter the numbers 1,4,7,2. The "EEPROM" numbers should be on the tv screen.
    * Make note of the fourth pair of numbers. Mine was 45.
    * Using the right arrow, place the cursor under the '5' in the fourth pair. With the cursor under the 5, enter the number '6'. The numbers on the xbv343 display should now read "46".
    * Now press "pause", power off and back on and play your vcd.

<b>Odd End #3</b>: My ankle, which I injured while when I slipped down a flight of stairs several weeks ago, is still not in the best shape.  It's a great many colors, and is still two sizes too big.

<b>Odd End #4</b>:  Ever watch a tape of yourself from a long time ago?  I've gotta say, I did last night, and it is too funny for words!

And that's all that happened today, err, yesterday.  Join me next time when we talk about the inner workings of the Treo, how casting the movie is going, and what new photography I'll be posting!

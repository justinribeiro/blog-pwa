The new <a href="http://www.cardthrowingleague.com/">cardthrowingleague.com</a> website has launched!  This new little venture is really picking up steam, with three cut video already and filming of new matches taking place the next several weeks.  Card throwing never looked so cool.  The new project has had some heavy influence from heavy industry..errr...people.  The shirts are very cool however.  Check it out if you have a chance.  The videos alone are worth it.

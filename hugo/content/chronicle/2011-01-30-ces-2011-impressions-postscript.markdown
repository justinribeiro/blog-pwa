Things have been very busy. Yes, I was at CES 2011 for those who have asked.  I was there with <a href="http://bamm.tv">BAMM.TV</a> and I spent my days on the floor making contacts and setting up deals.  It was nothing less than a sprint and I had lost my voice by day four.  Overall, we were able to do a lot of business, and that's always a plus (and is sort of the point).

Overall impressions:

* Tablets everywhere, all running Android for the most part.  We threw a lot of our upcoming HTML5 and JavaScript heavy apps at them to test performance and they all performed quite well.
* I saw Android on pretty much everything, running all kinds of weird stuff.
* You really don't know how many ODM's there are until you've spent four days on the floor.  I'm pretty sure I could easily have a rocket built to take me to the moon.
* I never want to see an iAccessory again.
* I saw a lot of gear that I wish they'd let take home to hack on.

It's going to be a fun build up as some of the deals begin to make there way public this year.  I can't speak to many of them (shhhhhhhh...shh), but they're coming.

In the mean time, a few random snaps from the show that can't even begin to explain the magnitude.  We were often just too busy to take photos...and you they don't let you take pictures of stuff that hasn't come out yet. :-)

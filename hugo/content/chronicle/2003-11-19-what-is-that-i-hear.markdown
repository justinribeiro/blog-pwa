title: What is that I hear?

I hear pudding,
I taste pie,
I see myself in the sky.
In shortly six days,
I shall fly,
To a place where heaven and life collide,
Food and fixings what a treat,
To sit with loved one's and eat.
Delights I envision,
Happiness I foresee,
My Family is everything to me.

I'm not a great poet, as a matter of fact, I'm barely a poet, okay we've all come to the conclusion I'm not a poet. But hey, it's Thanksgiving!  Have some heart, or at least some more turkey!

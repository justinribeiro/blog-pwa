With the script being read and revised, the rest of the movie is moving forward.  Time has been tight lately, with a number of things happening at once.  Major storyboards for the shots have started materializing, shooting locations are being scouted and the initial budget has been made.


I am seeking additional funding for this picture.  This is an independent film so keep in mind that when I say funding, I'm talking thousands of dollars, not millions.  This will be a full length motion picture, will be shown at various film festivals, and then distributed in independent movie houses and DVD. If any one is interested, please contact me at <a href="mailto:justin@j5studios.com">justin@j5studios.com</a>.

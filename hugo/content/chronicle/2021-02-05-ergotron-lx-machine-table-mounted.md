Back in 2019, my Dad and I created some [Ergotron LX  wall mounts](/chronicle/2019/02/15/welding-up-a-custom-ergotron-lx-wall-mount-bracket/) with some angle iron and welding. Those mounts have been amazing and have taken a fair amount of abuse from the kids moving them around at all matter of angles.

Knowing that said mount and arm would take kid usage wear, I figured it was time to use the last one I had for the my machine table. This machine table, a [McMaster-Carr steel table](https://www.mcmaster.com/machine-tables/steel-tables-9/) specifically, is not a light duty table; it'll take a 2,000 lbs capacity. As such it's a very used setup and floats around the darkroom and shop areas of the garage (I added a heavy caster wheel base that matches the weight rating and glides as if butter on a hot skillet) and doubles to house my [Airwolf AXIOM 3D printer](/chronicle/2020/07/27/four-years-and-two-fixes-for-airwolf-3d-axiom-3d-printer/) underneath. That table is the generic work-on-stuff table for a lot of projects and I hate giving up space valuable table space for a laptop, phone, or in some cases a scope.

Given the requirement and since I had the mount ready, I side mounted by drilling a couple holes in a leg and with just the right position of the arm placement I not only get 360 degrees of swing freedom but it's also off the table surface edge to not interfere when I need more space.

A few bolts and washers later, and we're mounted to the table.

In practice this has worked out quite lovely the last few months. I can be working on a project, fire up a stream without issue, and it all just wheels around without any effort required. Sometimes, it's the simple upgrades that make working on a project not only easier, but enjoyable.

I was asked the other day as to why I haven't been actively updating my Photography gallery section as often I have in the past.  There a few reasons for this:

* A lot less time 
* A lot of my shooting is done on film these days 
* A lot less time to scan the film 

Having less time is mostly due to work concerns, as I've been actively starting a funded start-up in Palo Alto the last few months.  It's more of a stealth project and I can't say much about it, but it's taken a lot of my time and energy.

I also tend to shoot a lot more film these days.  Between my grandfathers Continamatic III, the Rolliecord, and the Speed Graphic, I just always seem to have a film camera in hand rather the digital SLR.  I haven't yet scanned this film because I don't have the fancy scanner I'd like to use (though for the record, I'm still using a 15 year old Microtek with good results).

I have more photographs to put online from recent trips (including Las Vegas and some Mojave desert shots).  In the mean time, enjoy!

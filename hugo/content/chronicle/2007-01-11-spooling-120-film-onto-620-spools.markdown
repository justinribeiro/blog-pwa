We've come across a few 620 film cameras from the 1950's and 1960's, and generally speaking they're fairly simple point and shoots.  In particular, the Ansco Rediflex and the Imperial Debonair.


620 film isn't made any more, per say.  120 film is the same size for the most part, just on larger diameter spools.  If you were to attempt to buy new film on 620 spools from somewhere like B and H in New York, you'd find yourself paying $10-11 per roll, which is ridiculous considering the cost of a roll of Fujifilm 120 is $1.99.  Your option?  Respool.


You'll have to find some 620 spools (we were able to find them at garage sales for next to nothing and on Ebay if you're patient and don't get into a bidding war). The article I read used as my basis was Glenn E. Stewart's <a href="http://www.getnet.net/~gstewart/respool.htm">"Respooling 120 film onto 620 spools for use in older cameras"</a>, which includes nice pictures.


I was going to practice on a roll in the light first, but decided to just go for broke.  620 spool and a 120 roll of film tossed into the changing bag, and away I went.  I was amazed at how easy it actually was; I really did think it was going to be much more difficult.  I went slow, didn't get in a rush, and found that it didn't take much time at all.


Needless to say, if you find yourself looking to use that 620 camera, I'd suggest that article, a dark room, and taking you time.  You'll save money in the long run!

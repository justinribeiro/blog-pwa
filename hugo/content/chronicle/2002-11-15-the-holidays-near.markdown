Well, as someone who likes to think of the holidays as a time to go home, I'm glad to finally see them in sight. I'm pleased to be able to go home for the holidays, although I know many people who don't get the chance.

I'm not sure how this holidays season will go.  Economic times don't look great, but the forth quarter retail numbers should be good i imagine.  The war with Iraq could put a damper on things if old GW gets trigger happy. Then again, if Iraq attacks, then there's nothing like a jolt of nationalism for the economy they always say.

I'm working in a new little project, a perl script that will parse a palm datebook DB file and output it in icalendar format. I've got demo working, which allows me to move it into evolution with relative ease.  I'm pleased so far with the results, but haven't got around to making it human usable yet.

I had an opportunity to shoot two rugby matches that were happening at USF this weekend. I've seen rugby matches on television from overseas, but watching in person is something else! Really entertaining action.

I also shot a roll of Ilford HP5+ in the Continamatic III, but I have yet to develop it.  I used it mostly when action was close and from  a low angle to try to get some interesting looking photographs. With any luck, I'll get around to developing them and three other rolls I have sitting around in the very near future.

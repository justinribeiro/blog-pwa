I'll be attending [Edgeconf in San Francisco](https://edgeconf.com/2014-sf) in September to talk about pushing the web forward. The lined up panels are stacked with a great amount of talented folks doing some great work and I'm looking forward to the debate format. I really enjoyed Edgeconf in New York last year (sadly, I wasn't able to attend Edge in London), and the installable panel I'm excited about.

Hope to see you there!

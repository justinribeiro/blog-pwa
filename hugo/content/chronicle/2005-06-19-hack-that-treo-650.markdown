It was only a matter of time that I would take matters into my own hands and start hacking the Treo 650.  But what kind of hack to do?  Since I have a locked Cingular version, I though that first thing's first; I don't like being locked into anything.  Low and behold, I find that everyone seems to be applying a firmware hack that allows the Cingular Treo 650 to become an unlocked version.  It seemed dangerous (any time you're dealing with firmware, it's always a risk) and fun all at the same time.  I used the instructions at <a href="http://blog.treonauts.com/2005/06/cingular_treo_6.html">Treonauts</a> and at <a href="http://www.uneasysilence.com/how-to-upgrade-locked-cingular-gsm-to-unlocked-gsm/">uneasysilence.com</a>

But the real question you're probably wondering, did I actually follow the instructions, and did it result in an updated, unlocked phone.  I can report that I read the instructions letter by letter (on both pages I linked to above) and it worked fine for me.  No complaints.  Only thing I can recommend is backup, backup and backup, and then go slow.  Read the instructions carefully, and don't rush.  It took me about an hour and half, given that I backed up several times to different devices, and then slowly went through the instructions.

Hopefully this fixes some of the problems I've been having with stability in the web browser (it's not in the update release notes, but hey I can hope).

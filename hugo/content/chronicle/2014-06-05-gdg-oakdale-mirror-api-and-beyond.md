Gave a 45 minute talk to kick off our new local Google Developer Group, [GDG Oakdale](https://plus.google.com/b/117677091518865462359/117677091518865462359/about). I debated on whether to do one around Chrome and ChromeOS, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to do a talk on Glass development (which I find to be pretty awesome).

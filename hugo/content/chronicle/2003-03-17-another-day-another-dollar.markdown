So begins another Monday, being it St. Patricks Day, I suppose today everyone will be speaking in Irish accents, and very poor ones at that.  The people on the radio this morning were doing they're horrible version of it.  Say it with me: dialect coach. :-)

That also leads me to my next point.  Okay, I don't have one.  But this would be a great place for it.  To St. Pat's with it, I'm going back to work.

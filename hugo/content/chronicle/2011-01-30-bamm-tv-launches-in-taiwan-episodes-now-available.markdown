In time for Chinese New Year, <a href="http://bamm.tv/">BAMM.TV</a> has launched on Chunghwa Telecom's <a href="http://mod.cht.com.tw/MOD/Web/content/">MOD set top box platform</a> in Taiwan.

Many thanks to everyone who made this happen in such a short period of time, from the video team at BAMM.TV studios in San Francisco, to Chunghwa Telecom and our partners in Taiwan, <a href="http://taiclouds.com/">TaiClouds</a>.

We'll be sending more episodes of great, original BAMM.TV content to CHT in the coming months.  In the mean time, if happen to be in Taiwan, be sure to check us out!

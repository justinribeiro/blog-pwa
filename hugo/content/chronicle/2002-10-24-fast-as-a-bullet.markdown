title: Fast as a bullet?

Things are beginning to catch speed as the month of October comes to a close.  I've got new web applications coming out for several clients, I'm preparing for the LSAT, and I'm still peddling business ideas to those that will listen.  It just so happens that there seem to be a few more people listening the usual, which is always a plus.

In other news, the Giants are tied up with the Angels 2-2 in the series.  David Bell came through in the clutch yet again.  Man, I love that guy!  I attempted to get tickets to tonights game five (yes, I was willing to fly to SF from Seattle for one game) but didn't have any luck.  I had lunch with my old law professor today, who's son is a doctor in SF.  He was able to get into game four last night. Too Sweet!

Now, for an interesting fact that I had a debate with some friends on.  A bullet leaves the barrel of a gun at around 2,000 ft a second.  The space shuttle in orbit has a speed of 5 miles per second.  Yes, you read that right.  Imagine being able to go 5 miles a second on earth.  I could go Seattle to Modesto in under 3 minutes, instead of the 12-16 hour drive.  Of course, I don't see it happening any time soon.  Though it would give new meaning to commuting.

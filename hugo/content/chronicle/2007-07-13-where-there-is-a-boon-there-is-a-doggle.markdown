Reading time: 1 minute.



* The <a href="/photography/">photography</a> section has been updated with new galleries.  I'm even uploading more as I type this.
* I have stopped using Adobe Reader for viewing PDF's in Windows.  I'm now using the free <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">Foxit Reader 2.0</a>, and the speed increase is just awe inspiring.  I'm actually reading PDF's again.  As a comparision: Adobe Reader install: 117MB, 10 second load.  Foxit Reader: 1.67MB, nearly instant load.
* I purchased Monica a new Canon 100-400 f4.5-5.6 L for wildlife photography.  She's liking it very much.
* Speaking of photography gear, Monica and I will not be attending the <a href="http://photofair.com/">Photo Fair</a> in San Jose on July 14.  It's the first time we haven't gone in a while, but we've confirmed one of our favorite vendors won't be attending (whom we usually buy old darkroom and camera parts from).  We'll make the next one.  If you've never gone, they do have some great stuff but expect having to hunt.
* My "big news" is still in the pipes.  Sometimes big things are hard to squeeze through little pipes.

Monica and I have been hooking up every set of speakers we can to Chromecast Audio. The device has been a godsend in terms of just music everywhere and really complimenets our records and various other musical media (no one wants to take a record outside).

Case in point: Chromecast Audio hooked up to our 1970's era Magnavox Astro Sonic stereo sounds so sweet. Getting a little meta with the Who's Next record and the remastered playing through Cast.﻿

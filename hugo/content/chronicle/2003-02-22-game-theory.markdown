I recently have been reading up on game theory, which I really haven't done for some time.  It amazes me how much one can amass from learning such a useful theory.  Most people have heard of the Prisoners Dilemma, but know little about what it means.  No, I'm not going to explain it, when someone far more knowledge can do it.  Head over to <a href="http://www.gametheory.net">Game Theory.net</a> for more information.

I suppose the reason I've been reading about it, is because I find myself in the same dilemma.  Pity.

Have I mentioned <a href="http://www.chezjane.com">Chez Jane Gourment Garlic Spreads</a> lately?  Yummy.  Go buy some.  Mention Justin.

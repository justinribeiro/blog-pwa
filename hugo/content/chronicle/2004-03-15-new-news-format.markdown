If you haven't noticed, the news section has a new look.  I decided to go with a "five recent stories" format. I also pretty much rewrote the Rodin software I was using in a more OOP friendly format.  For good measure, I added my own archive function (based on my photography gallery code), and am in the process of getting the RSS working.  It's ongoing work so things will probably change a bit more over the next few versions.

Yes, I'll be at <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/index.html">Google I/O</a>, starting Monday at <a href="http://www.io-bootcamp.com/">IO Bootcamp</a>.  I'll be hitting a combination of a few different tracks (Android, Chrome, Dev Tools), but overall I'd like to work with some the technologies I haven't before (I'd like to see some of the Geo API's and Datastore).

Overall, it should be a very interesting next three days!

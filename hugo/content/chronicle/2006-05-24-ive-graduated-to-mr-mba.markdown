title: I've graduated to Mr. MBA

It was down to the wire, but apparently all good things come to an end.  I have graduated from the University of San Francisco with a Master degree in Business Administration, better known as an MBA.  Graduation was on May 19th, and I walked in a black robe, drab, and cords with many friends to get what I think is my last degree.  The ceremony was pleasant if not a tad bit long but then again which graduation isn't.

Make no mistake, I will miss many people I've come to call friends as we branch out into the wild west of business all over the world.  Taiwan, Japan, Turkey, Brazil, East Coast, West Coast...everyone is headed to do great things.  There has not been any greater sense of joy then to have gotten the opportunity to work with such brilliant people.  Grabbing a drink after work and hanging out with those still in San Francisco borders on fanastic...we no longer have to discuss when papers are due for class!  Happy day!

So what am I doing now that I have this new found fancy degree?  Same thing we do every night Pinky...try to take over the world! See, I haven't lost my sense of humor. :-)

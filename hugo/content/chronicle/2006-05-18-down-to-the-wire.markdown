Well it has all come down to this.  Today is my last final, my last class in the Master of Business Administration program at the University of San Francisco.  Tomorrow I graduate in the black robe gown thing with my peers.

This of course assumes that I do not royally screw up my last final today.  Don't you love it when things come down to one event, one deciding factor that could alter the course of history as you know it?  I say bring it on, let the fun begin, hey band start playing.  It's been a wild ride to say the least, why would today be any different.

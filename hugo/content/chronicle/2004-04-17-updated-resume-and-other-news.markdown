Having recently returned from my San Francisco apartment hunt and a nice little fanily Easter day event, I decided I needs to kick it into gear and get things done.


I've updated my business resume, and it now in a new format.  I decided it was time for change that better reflected what I do these days.  Downloading the Word version is your best bet (it will open in OpenOffice just fine), since I have not yet made a style matched web version as of yet.  It looks fairly slick, and get this, has actual updated business functions!  About time.


I am aware that I haven't put up the weather mapping code yet.  Don't worry, I'll get to hopefully sometime within the week.  Thank you to those that emailed asking.


At this time, I would like to make note that I am still planning a move to San Francisco in June, so things are going to get hectic in a hurry.

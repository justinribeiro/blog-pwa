When we bought the house now nearly four years ago the house came littered with Amazon Ring hardware. Old door sensors, keypads, cameras, you name a Ring device and chances were good that the previous owners had it. Over time, as we would find Ring devices in various states and odd places—a doorbell that was not a doorbell—we'd remove the device and throw it into a bin. Littered you see is the correct term in this case; not only was there scattered devices around the property, there was new-in-box Ring devices in a closet waiting to be used.

As you can imagine, we were not up for such use, given the [techno-authoritarianism and mass surveillance](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/amazon-ring-cashes-techno-authoritarianism-and-mass-surveillance) that these devices enable.

As such, goodbye old devices that we did not use. May the recycler find your parts of some value.

Fun fact: that's not even all of them. This is bin number 2. The other devices were lets say, in poor condition. Because of the hammer that I used.

I had not slept in a few days, as doctoral PhD defenses are not a guarantee you succeed. Yes, you will have time to present your case. Yes, your committee will ask you questions of varying degrees on not only the presentation but the dissertation they have been reading over the course of a year (or longer in some of my advisors cases). Yes, I just spent four years building this 323 page dissertation across three studies.

However, by no means do they have to pass you. They will put you through the paces, and you must not stumble. They will test your rigor, your knowledge, your logic. Otherwise, back again to that blinking cursor to theorize and apply new ideas.

As defenses preparation goes, I felt well prepared. I have given presentations on various parts of this research at conferences for the last couple years and was use to questions and sparing. I had dry-ran the presentation in Finland at Aalto University a few weeks prior. This version was slightly longer to accommodate feedback, but the overarching story or it's theoretical basis were unchanged. Heaven forbid you're picking theory a couple weeks out; a recipe for disaster by all accounts.

And I am a seasoned speaker. So I was ready.

Or so you tell yourself.

I do not remember all the words I said, in respect to the moment. You find your flow and you calmly make your case; the words and numbers make sense, the math clicks, you make some quips and then you stick the landing with the integration and theoretical synthesis. The questions my committee asked were well played and well positioned, they made me think on my feet and draw not only on my knowledge but to not fall for the logical traps. Folks I know who had not seen a defense before commented they felt I was grilled; I was not by any means.

Frankly, through all the stress and in the moment, I was simply having fun.

Sure, there were hiccups. The moment the CWRU marching band begin playing outside much to the grins and chuckles of my audience, which made me break stride as the music ramped up. A changed slide that I forgot to hit the point earlier caused a stutter in my voice as my brain caught up. I had probably done a better version in the dry-run I thought. On the whole however, it went smoothly.

And after a mere 10 minutes of deliberation, Kalle came back in, said "white smoke", shook my hand and hugged me as he called me Doctor Ribeiro. It is a moment I will not forget. Relief, joy, and new horizons, wrapped into one handshake.

The pass was with minor edits to the dissertation, a joyful moment in an of itself. The long nights gone, I turned around those edits a mere week later. With those edits accepted, and the graduate school paper work complete, the manuscript is now undergoing formatting for delivery to the library for publishing.

Dr. Justin Ribeiro, Ph.D. So very surreal.

`***`

_The following is reprinted from my dissertation acknowledgement section, as I find it important to note those that helped me complete this journey._

Choosing to dare mighty things, NASA’s motto, begins by realizing that you do not undertake the great unknown alone. I am eternally grateful to the many colleagues, family, and friends who have along the way been instrumental in this endeavor.

To my dissertation committee—Kalle Lyytinen, Philip Cola, James Gaskin, Neil Maiden, Aron Lindberg—thank you for your patience, persistence, and unwavering guidance through what I can only imagine felt like an endless tide of thoughts and drafts over the past year. Your wisdom, encouragement, and rigorous feedback have shaped this work in ways I could never have achieved alone, and I am profoundly grateful for your time and dedication. To my chair, Kalle Lyytinen, words cannot fully capture the depth of my gratitude for your mentorship and investment in my growth. At every turn, you challenged me to think more critically while writing more concisely, urging me to strip away the excess and distill my thoughts into their most powerful form. You demanded more than I thought I could give, yet somehow, you always made me believe I could rise to the occasion. Your relentless pursuit of excellence set a bar higher than I ever imagined, and because of that, I have grown into a sharper researcher, a more thoughtful writer, and, most importantly, a more introspective thinker. To Philip Cola, had you not been there at the very start of this journey, I truly don’t know if I would have made it to the finish line. Your unparalleled teaching, tireless encouragement, and belief in my abilities gave me the confidence to push forward even when the path seemed impossible. You didn’t just help me navigate the climb—you made me believe I could scale heights I had never even dared to dream of. Your support has been a guiding force, and I am forever grateful for the wisdom and kindness you have shared along the way.

My efforts would have further been constrained had it not been for the wider Case Western Reserve University DBA and PhD program community. To the many professors who spent the time to not only teach but to mentor, I am in your debt: Corrine Coen, Yunmei Wang, Sherry Sanger, Heather Long, and Eileen Doherty-Sil. This dissertation would not have been possible without you. A fervent set of thanks to Sue Nartker and Shelley Muchnicki, for keeping us all focused on what mattered, on track and on time, and frankly, sane in the face of endless deadlines.

To my venerated cohort, Dr. Dalana Brand, Dr. Donna Contat, Dr. Dereck Faulkner, Dr. Dalithia Smith, and future doctors Tom Shaver, Pankaj Vishram Jadhav, and Dan Harris, I am profoundly grateful for your kindness, camaraderie, and unwavering support. Few truly understand the rigor and time demanded by this research, and without you, the journey would have been far colder and lonelier. I am immensely thankful for every shared dinner, every moment of laughter, and every conversation that reminded me why this path is worth the effort. I look forward to many more years of friendship and to climbing even higher together as we continue to pursue our ambitions.

To my family and friends, I offer my heartfelt thanks for listening, for your patience, and for putting up with the ramblings of a tired student. Your support has meant the world to me. To my brilliant wife, Monica, the true scientist in the family, none of this would be possible without your unwavering love and encouragement. You have always been my guiding light in the darkness, and for that, I am endlessly grateful. To my amazing children, Alli, Isa, and Eve, thank you for your small but mighty acts of love, for leaving snacks on my desk while I wrote, and for making me laugh when nothing seemed to be clicking. Your joy and kindness (and meme’s) carried me through even the toughest moments. I love you more than words can say. To my incredible Mom and Dad, thank you for believing in your young son enough in the 1980s to let him write code and fearlessly take apart computers that, in hindsight, I now realize cost a small fortune. Your trust and encouragement gifted me a lifetime of curiosity, and for that, I am forever grateful. To my younger siblings, Katie and Jim, thank you for keeping my secrets and never ratting me out to Mom and Dad about just how many times smoke rose from those circuit boards as I desperately tried to figure things out.

To the many friends who showed understanding when I was buried in edits and lacking in social graces, whose messages of encouragement arrived at just the right moment, I cannot thank you enough. James Cha-Earley, Jessica Earley-Cha, James Duvall IV, Paul Perrone, Melissa Ginder, Laura Krake, Russell Kornman, Sid Uberoi and so many others, your kindness and support helped carry me through this journey. I am grateful beyond words, and I look forward to the days ahead when I can return the favor, celebrate new milestones together, and embark on the next chapter with the same spirit of encouragement and friendship that you so generously shared with me.

Finally, thank you to all the software developers I spoke with who generously sacrificed their time to share their perspectives and experiences in this crazy business we call software development. This dissertation would not have been possible without your honesty and candor.

title: The emulation of characters

All too often, I find that people tend to compare me to characters from various mediums, be it television or the occastional movie.  Not theatre however; possibly because many of the people I know, do not go to the theatre, or because those that do would rather not mention it.

Increasingly, I begin to see the very characterizations that they so promently put forward.  I admit, it is an odd thing to be better know as a character rather then a person to friends.  Are they in love with that character so much as to mold me in that way, or have I simply taken on the persona for the simple sake of doing so as a form of comic relief?  I imagine the later, since I'm always in for a good laugh, be it at my expense, it makes no difference to me.

Tough times these days.  War drums beat, economic figures are white washed and panned, and people are just kind of dragging along.  If people would only realize that increased saving during economic hardship often prolongs economic hardship, things might be better.  But explaining the economics of things doesn't help, and with good reason.  It's about perception of future events, and when the future is a messy blur of new tax law, war, and a few million of factors that effect a given person, well, saving looks like a mighty good idea.  Can't blame a person for that.

Also, goalkeepers stick together.  Crazy group.  Love'em.

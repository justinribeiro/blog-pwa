Some folks ask me if I still work on NFC related things. The short answer, yes.

The longer answer is that I pestered friend and fellow Google Dev Expert [https://twitter.com/kennethrohde](Kenneth Christiansen) to send me over an early Chromium build that he's been working on that his work on webNFC:

A couple of things to note:

1. The app in the screenshot was an app that Kenneth built in Polymer for testing (and works pretty well).
2. If you're not following [Kenneth on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kennethrohde), you probably should be. :-)

No ETA when that lands, but I thought a screenshot might make some folks happy. The [response on Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinribeiro/status/710625561257713664) leads me to believe so.

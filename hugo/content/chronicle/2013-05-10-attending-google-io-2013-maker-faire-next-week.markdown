It's going to be a very busy week.

## Google I/O 2013
I'll be in San Francisco pretty much all of next week attending <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/">Google I/O 2013</a>. I'll be hitting a mix of talks and code labs, little Android, Web and of course I'll be hitting all the Glass talks. I'll be at the <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cm6l1qj16ktg9f8sv69ep7b2rhk">Google+ PhotoWalk for I/O</a>, pretty sure I'll stop by the <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ckmuvhffqqi3vba6eot8ipjbpgc">Chrome Pre-I/O meetup</a>, and I'll be at the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6275120053">Pitch Night!</a> event on Thursday.

Second time going, super excited. Great time to talk to developers on the front line and trade secrets. Whoooooooo.

## Maker Faire Bay Area 2013
I'll be at <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a> with my wife and oldest little girl, Alli on Saturday and Sunday (the 1.5 year old twins are not coming with us). Alli wants to build a fairly complicated robot this summer, so if you're around Maker Faire and have a robot, she's going to ask you a few hundred questions. You've been warned. :-)

I love going to Maker Faire. Nice people, great ideas, just a lot of family fun (and hacking)!

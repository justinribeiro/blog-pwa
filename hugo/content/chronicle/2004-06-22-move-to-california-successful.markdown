I have made it back to California in one piece.  My brother and I piloted both a moving truck and my car back along I-5.  It was about 17 hours, which wasn't too bad with a loaded moving truck.


Ironically, my Malibu did nearly 37 miles per gallon at one point, and averaged about 33 miles per gallon the entire trip.  This was beyond my dreams, and even the moving truck did 16 miles per gallon!  Very good trip.


I will remain in the central valley for a while, until I find new digs in San Francisco. Fun time ahead!

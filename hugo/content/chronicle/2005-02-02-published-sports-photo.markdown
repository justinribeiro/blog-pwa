Having heard from my good fried Josh, it appears one of my recent wrestling photographs has been published by the local paper (which does not have a web site that I can find unfortunately).  The photo in question would be <a href="http://j5studios.com/photography/index.php/2005_01_10__Waterford_Wrestling_Match/123">"the switch"</a>, which I had made a quick print copy of for Josh.


Had I known that this was going to be published, I probably would have changed the white balance on the photo, since I was shooting in AUTO during the event.  I find that changing white balance is pretty easy with the digital negative (aka the RAW file).


Overall I'm flattered that it was published at all.  I though the hand out of focus wasn't great, but that it does show motion of the subject.  One of the last frames I shot that night, and probably one of the best.


<b>UPDATE:</b> It turns out that I was not credited for the photograph.  I contacted the editor to protect my copyright, and the issue has been resolved with a correction being printed.

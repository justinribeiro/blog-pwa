A vise is only as good as two things: its ability to hold the work and its ability to do so without moving around while working on the work. The second part is typically a choice of the user; what you attach that vice to should be secure enough to not slide around bench. Vices are not particularly inexpensive items but over the years I've maintained a watchful eye for banged up and restorable vices of various types. The casual observer may ask why I have so many varied types of vices—I hold a lot of odd workpieces.

Case in point: the Panavise Model 201 Vise, better known as "Junior". I do not recall where or when I picked up this vice, through I seemingly have had this vice forever; it's my favorite vice for working on electronics. It's small and nimble, and you can buy it new for around $50 USD these days which I find not terrible. My issue with it is that it's not heavy and really needs to be attached to a bench or base.

Over the years, I've clamped it tables, bolted it to benches, but the mobility—I like to set a piece and spin the vise around without changing the orientation of the work—suffers in those cases. I could spend the $60-ish dollars and use the official Panavice 308 Weighted Vise Base and solve my problem.

But that's no fun.

Instead Monica and I were out and about on a misty Saturday morning having coffee and happened upon a machinist shop selling some stock and tools before a move. While I did not buy the warehouse-sized CNC machine, for $20 we did pick up some random metal stock and scrap, chunks too small to be viable in a machine shop of this nature (e.g., they were building processing plant hardware for the plant down the street the owner noted to us).

Thankful for the small bounty and a newly renewed in my need to use my Model 201 for a project I am working on, I set out to quickly punch, drill, and tap the base. Given this was actually very nice steel, this was a quick and painless task.

Now, why did I use much-too-nice stainless steel 1/4-20 machine bolts for this project? Because I have a lot of them for the other project I'm working on and they were with grabbing distance. I—or you, should you endeavor such a build—could choose different bolts. I use what I have on hand.

I did take a hand file* and worked the edges to a do-not-cut-my-finger level of smoothness, as well as removed a good layer of surface rust. As offcut steel goes, this piece was frankly incredibly flat per my Starrett, which I don't need for a vice, but still.

The new base adds a lot of weight and I frankly love it. I've been poking and soldering lately and the base makes all the difference. I wish I would have done this sooner.

&ast; Yes, an actual hand file. I learned when I was a kid how to use files, on the farm and in school. I highly recommend watching old shop instructional videos on the basics, but it's a great skill to have and more versatile than you think.

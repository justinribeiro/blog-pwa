Off the heals of the [Polymer 3 release](https://www.polymer-project.org/blog/2018-05-09-polymer-at-io-2018.html) a week or so ago at Google I/O, I've updated my [Polymer v2/v3 Snippets for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=justinribeiro.Polymer2Snippets) extension to version 1.0.

Included in this release:

- Added Snippets
  - `p-polymer-element` - Polymer 3 Web Component defintion
  - `p-lit-element` - Lit-Element Web Component definition
  - `p-mixin` - ES6 arrow function subclass return
  - `p-mixin-dedup` - Sharable mixin utilizing Polymer's dedupingMixin
- Breaking
  - `p-polymer-customelement` - Removed (out of date)

With the shift towards more use of the excellent `lit-html`, I'll be added some additional snippets and work around that as time goes on.

Want to contibute or have an issue with the extension? [Pull requests and issues](https://github.com/justinribeiro/vscode-polymer2-snippets) happily welcome.

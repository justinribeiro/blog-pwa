It has been a very busy last few weeks, with many things going on.


    * My buddy <a href="http://www.jamesduvall.com/">James Duvall</a> and his wife Sandy had their little girl Luna on August 22nd.  You can check his page for pictures and some video.
    * James and I have been hacking on some PHP and Flash to create a version of the VideoSpark FLV player that works more to our liking.  Notably, we've built in video looping and XHTML compliant code.  You can check it out in his <a href="http://jamesduvall.com/videos/">video section</a>.
    * Speaking of video, you'll notice on his page a <a href="http://www.yourmediacoverage.com/">YMC, Your Media Coverage</a> video preview.  We've been restoring some old video from 1997-98, and are throwing around the idea of bringing the show back in a new format.
    * The fall semester has started at USF, and I am still pursuing my MBA and working on research for my Dean's Fellowship.
    * My sister Katie turned 20.
    * My brother Jim turned 23.
    * My "sister" Emily turned 26.
    * Alisa and JD are expecting their little boy Finley in October.
    * Some of my photographs will hopefully being showing in a gallery show in San Francisco in October and November (keeping my fingers crossed)!

As you can see, lots of action.  I love it!

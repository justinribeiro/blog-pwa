I can't believe it is almost June.  This realization only seem to hit me last week, when I figured out, oh ya, I need to start doing this move thing.  My pending move to San Francisco is in short order, only a few weeks away.  This will leave me little time to do many things that I have on my list, but so it goes.


My move date is not currently set in stone, though it will be fairly quick like.  I've decided that I'm going to do the <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> thing, using virtual phone numbers for increased phone coverage.  Their service reps seem nice, and I think I there service should work fine over the broadband I end up using.


Otherwise, here's hoping the winds of change don't bow me off course.

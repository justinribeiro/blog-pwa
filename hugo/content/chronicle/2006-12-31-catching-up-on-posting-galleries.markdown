I'm trying to catch up on posting some new photography galleries.  There are now four new galleries in the <a href="/photography/">Photography</a> section. Included are test rolls from the Kodak 35 and Kodak Signet 30 cameras, which produced some interesting results.

I have several rolls of film left to develop and scan, including pictures taken with a Rolliecord 1A, Ansco Rediflex, and Imperial Debonair.  The rolls I have developed look great so far, so I'm hoping to get good scans completed soon.

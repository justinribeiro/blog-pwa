title: The road to mashups and mobile web apps

Lately it seems as if all I've been doing is reviewing code and managing projects for the ever increasing niche of web-mashups and mobile applications.  I've touched and crushed as I like to put it, pretty much all the fancy web service API's lately.  I'll admit, I do like Google's API's; I find them simple to use and pretty extensive and useful application can be done with a little elbow grease.  I've been pawing around Facebook's APIs as well, but haven't written anything for on their application platform yet.


This leads me to my car mileage tracker I've been keeping all these years.  I recently wrote a small web app so that I could push data to it via my Treo, instead of syncing the data from the desktop from ThinkDB.  The application itself is simple, there's not much to it.  But it started to make me wonder about Apple's new little darling iPhone, and it's supposed wonderful web browser.  Blazer on my Treo is pretty much worthless most of the time, especially on ATT/Cingular's network.  Frankly I haven't heard wonderful things about the iPhone on the ATT network, but the hacking that's going on within the iPhone community keeps me interested.


Needless to say, the road to quality web based applications is much easier now then it used to be.  I like the business case for them, and I like the functionality they can provide.  Mashable web services and the new mobile revolution (fingers crossed that between the iPhone and Nokia's web browsers things really start jumping) are maintaining my interest.

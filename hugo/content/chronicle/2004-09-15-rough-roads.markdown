Just when you think you have found smooth road to cruise down, low and behold there are always bumps.  Then those bumps turn into holes, then there's a sort of war zone feeling to things and everything goes wrong.  This is the sum of this week up to this point.


I'm trying to be optimistic, but sometimes when you've been kicked to the ground, each time it gets harder to get up.  Such is life I suppose.


Needless to say, I feel like I'm slipping behind on most of my side projects, since the projects in front of me are taking more time then I originally had thought.  It's fine, just unexpected.


Also, people seem to be forgetting my name.  Last two days, people who should have gotten my name by now just plain up forgot.  Not even a guess.  Just plum forgotten. Somewhat insulting in my opinion.  Then again, I really honestly don't care, but I usually leave enough impression in 3 weeks to not be forgotten.  Damn.

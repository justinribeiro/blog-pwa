As you probably can see, things have changed on the site quite a bit.  I've added a new gallery engine, this new news engine, and have tweaked the design.

More changes will continue, as I add additional projects, porfolio items and updates to software and scripts I written.  I'll also be updating the galleries, as I take pictures.

Until then, you can check this page for updates on what is going on.  You can always contact me, but I know people are busy, so check here to actually see which state I'm in (both mentally and actually which US state I'm in!)

The lads and I over at Stickman recently had the opportunity to head out to a local charter school's kickoff mini-Maker/Science Faire for their students and the community. We brought out a couple of the 3D printers and one of large touchscreens and let kids (and a few adults :-) put together [Dig Build Live](http://www.digbuildlive.com/) Minecraft figures designed by our chief artist and all around awesome friend <a href="https://twitter.com/BootBuckaroo">David Steele</a>. We printed about 200 and nearly all them are gone; we're glad folks enjoyed them.

The biggest takeaway (besides the general delight of the children) was the engaging conversation with parents. Lot's of interest about the multiple learning opportunities that can come with 3D printing (the math, the code, the engineering...all beyond just printing that object, but the how of getting there).

A big shout out to our buddy [Tyler Benziger](https://twitter.com/tybenz) for introducing us to the teachers and administration and having us come out. He ran a great booth with Chromebooks and learning to code!

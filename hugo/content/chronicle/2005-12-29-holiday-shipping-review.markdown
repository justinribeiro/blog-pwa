This year was the first year that I bought every given gift online.  It was also the first year that I've seen first hand how holiday shipping becomes the nightmare that drives people crazy.  Here's how they rate:


    * Fed-Ex: 5 stars.  Delivered 2 of 2 packages. All packages were on time and without injury.  I didn't have to call them, I didn't have to do anything. They just did what was asked.
    * UPS: 3 stars. Delievered 2 of 2 packages.  One package was on time, but the other was a disaster.  It was 4 days late and beat to death (luckly the gift was made of iron), and was only delieved after I called them a five times demanding.  The first time I was told it was put on the wrong truck.  No big deal, just deliever it tomorrow.  But it never showed.  Then I was told my house didn't exist (which is odd...they never had trouble finding it with the first package) and gave them directions.  By Day 4, I told them to just hold it and went down to pick it up when they dropped it off on the door step.  Not a pleasant experience, though I think this had to do with holiday work force more then anything since I never had a problem with them until that package.
    * DHL: 0 stars. Never delivered. I don't like DHL. I've had things shipped by them before (count 5 packages in the last year) and only one has ever made it to me.  Every time, they tell me that they tried to deliever but no one was home which just isn't true.  Then they tell me how my house is on a border line, and they don't know what truck to put it on.  Then when I go to pick it up, they physically lose the package.  I've given them every chance (I've given them directions, called in advance, done everything possible to make sure they can deliever my packages) but it just never works.  If you give me a choice, I will never ship via DHL.

I know what you're probably saying. "You should have shipped earlier." That may be true, but frankly I didn't wait until the last minute. I had this stuff ordered weeks in advance, and shipped well before Christmas.  No excuses.

Needless to say, I did get all my packages one way or another. Now I just have to ship a half dozen more gifts, and hopefully I'll still be as happy as can be.

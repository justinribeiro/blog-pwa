title: Site seeing, standup, and music on a Saturday

My good friend Megan, whom I've known forever it seems like, came to visit me this past weekend.  She wanted to see some sites, see some night life, and so we set out for a long but fun Saturday.  After some early morning rain, the sky's opened up and the sun shine was simply wonderful.

We made the rounds for site seeing; Coit Tower, Pier 39 and Seal Rocks all made picture perfect by the good round of weather.

After some quick dinner, we headed down to the Punchline, and saw some great standup comedy.  The Punchline is a very nice place to see standup comedy in my opinion. The people are very nice there, and the moment you walk in the buzz from the crowd is just great.

But with the comedy over with, why not catch some music?  We headed down to the Red Devil Lounge.  The doorman commented when looking at our i.d's "Ahhh, you kids are from the 80's, you'll love this band." Just so happened it was Fastball (I honestly didn't even recognize them, I thought it was a cover band), and they were rocking the place.  The Red Devil Lounge isn't really that big, but it's a fun spot to go. The bartenders are nice, the doorman was nice, and everyone just has a good time.  So we rocked out to songs that we remembered from high school, and drank into the night.

It just goes to show you that the one nice thing about living in the city is that you never know where you'll end up.

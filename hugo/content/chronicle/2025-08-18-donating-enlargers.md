Pursuing EBay or Craigslist for darkroom parts has become a mystical art best practiced under a full moon in the woods. From predatory shipping costs to an overuse of the word "rare", attempting to find parts can be quite the adventure in patience. Sure, there are better places to search—the classifieds on Photrio or Large Format Photography Forum I've had good luck over the years—though again, patience will come into play.

One of the more frustrating parts for folks trying to get a darkroom set-up is the enlarger itself. During the great film and darkroom purge at the beginning of the 2000's, you could pick up respectable if not downright mythical darkroom gear for pennies. These days, everyone wants frankly way too much money for a lot used enlargers in need of a lot more care and repair than sellers realize. More so, there are specific people who could benefit from those enlargers, particularly schools.

It is a devastating truth is that most school art programs are underfunded if funded at all. So it came to my surprise a month or so ago to run across a simple Craigslist post asking for darkroom and enlarger donations for a local high school near us in California. The post had been up for over a month when I found it; I hoped they had what they needed but I nonetheless inquired, given our own small collection of rescued enlargers and parts that we could donate.

To my disappoint, they had largely come up dry from posting all over the local and not-so-local web forums and social media. Many people wanted apparently had contacted and asked for either money or letters of donation for ungodly sums for broken down pieces of equipment, which I suppose is the sad state of the world these days. They needed enlargers and timers in particular; we had'em.

In total, we ended up donating three enlargers, three timers, clean lens for each, bulbs, and easels:

1. Vivitar VI enlarger and baseboard, 50mm and 75mm lens
2. Durst M300 and baseboard, 50mm lens
3. Bogan X-35B and baseboard, 50mm lens

I spent a day aligning and cleaning, as these enlargers had been in storage for some time. The two smaller enlargers are quite nifty for beginners; low effort, good outcomes, decent 8x10s from 35mm negatives. The larger Vivitar will do up to 6x6 and is still relatively simply to use. Paired with the ever-reliable GraLab 300's, you can't really go wrong.

I am still on the hunt for a couple more enlargers to donate—I have a couple that are in that needs-repair category—but if you find yourself with an enlarger in your local area, ask around. Maybe there is a teacher just looking to do a little more for the kids that you could help out. You never know the difference a little donation, a little help can do.

The title is fancy words that mean to say, I have no free time.


None.  Zip.  Zero.  Zilch.  The shear magnitude of work that is beginning to pile on top of me is truly nothing less then spectacular.  The funny thing is, it can actually get worse, and will get worse as the new year rolls on.


On a brighter note, the misery season, best known as Christmas, New Years, and Valentines will soon be over.  This is of course a reference to the show <i>Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place</i>, which I'm sure made reference to something else, and gasssp! I don't know what that reference is.


I feel obligted to note:


  * Yes, I have soccer pictures which have not been proofed yet.  Okay, one has been proofed, and sent to JPG Magazine, but that's it. 
  * The script for our first full length feature film is coming along nicely.  Hoping to set a shooting schedule, and start pre-production planning this weekend. 
  * I'm really, really tired.

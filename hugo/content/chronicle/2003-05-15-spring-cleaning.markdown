I recently was looking over some backup CD's, looking for some old work, and instead of finding what I was looking for, I found some old cases I wrote in college for my 489 thesis class.  So, I posted them on the portfolio page.

I also updated the top menu bar, which uses code I hacked up from Netscape DevEdge.  Very slick page they have over there, and while may page does not compare, I'm begining the slow process of leaving tables.

Haven't written anymore screenplay stuff, although I did story board a midsection of the film on a napkin the other day.

Recently sat down and read Tennessee Williams "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof".  The copy I read was actually from 1957, and included the alternate ending that was originally used on Broadway when the play opened, stage directions and all.  I'm not sure which ending I prefer; both have there strong points.  If I had to choose, I prefer Williams' first version over the version used in the play.  However, the second version seems more fit for the stage.  So, you've got a toss up.


If you have no read this masterpiece of a play, I suggest it.  Of course, I'm not an expert, but the play is deeply enjoyable, and I've decided to add Brick's main speech to my list of worked and polished monologues.

Been very busy after the holidays at work so haven't had a lot of time to partake in a lot of projects stuff lately, but I do want to mention that thanks to LuYu, Escputil GTK Perl FrontEnd is now available in GTK2, thanks to the porting to Perl-GTK2.  Take a look, it's pretty slick.  He did a fine job on it.


Hopefully if I get some time, the other perl-gtk scripts will also make the jump.  Stay tuned!

Busy time these past few weeks, and just when I think I get a breath, I'm right back under the water with more to do. I love it!

So what's been going on? Let me give you the break down:


    * I spent last weekend in the woods at an advanced leadership course (of which I can not speak what when on there). I will say that it was a very fun weekend and very enlightening. Every USF MBA should have to take that course.  Some pictures are located in the <a href="/photography/">Photography </a>section.
    * After nearly two years of searching, I finally brought a new coffee table, dinning room table, and chairs.  I found a designer named <a href="http://www.maxsf.com/">James Do</a> who had just the right look that I wanted.  He was even kind enough to help me chose the pieces, which was a plus.
    * My friend James Duvall recently put his new <a href="http://www.jamesduvall.com/top5/">Top 5</a> page up. Go over and give him hell for not putting John Ford's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049730/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Searchers</span></a> as a top 5 movie selection.
    * Work is on going on a new photo essay I'm partaking in, and I'm hoping to find some crew for a movie I'd like to continue shooting.
    * School is ongoing; I'm working on a business plan, learning important things about sales that I wish I would have known three years ago, and generally am enjoying my classes. The reading is heavy this semester, but nothing I can't handle.
    * My friends Emily and Jim are expecting their second child.  Congratulations!
    * Alisa and JD are expecting their little one, Finley, in the next few weeks.  Yipee!
    * I found a child on my doorstep this morning, and I've named him Sue.  I'm just kidding, that didn't happen.  :-)

This sums up what has been going on; through in some actual work, and a little sleep and you have the general idea of what I've been doing lately.

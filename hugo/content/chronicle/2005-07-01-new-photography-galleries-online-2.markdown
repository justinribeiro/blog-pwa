Just when you thought "Where's all the new pictures?", I come out an place three new galleries online.  These galleries are using the new 17-40 f/4L, and I must say my results have been great.

I should point out that the most recent gallery involves a bit of experimentation with the sensor of my 300D.  I know you're not supposed to do 30 minute exposures at 1600ISO; you get grainy star trails, yadda yadda yadda.  I find the result interesting none the less, because it actually turned out better then I thought (I did run it through Noise Ninja).  The light painting of my friend Josh walking in front of the camera also gave ghostly results.

As always, you can view the galleries in the <a href="/photography/">Photography section,</a>.

With shifting colors of fall and the quickly approaching winter chill, it's time to head into the darkroom to do some printing. The cooler temperatures make my working in our darkroom easier given that the heat of a California summer just makes working in this non-air conditioned space all but impossible.

In the process of running some test prints, things however didn't seem quite right. I was losing sharpness on the left side of my prints and there was a terrible slack in the focusing. It seemed that it was time for some maintenance on our Beseler 45MX.

The Beseler 45MX series of enlargers are generally considered to be an acquired taste. They are not the fanciest of enlargers, but with the ability to print from 4x5 negatives, its always been my go-to since we purchased it out of the back of a truck at the end of a photography swap meet in San Jose 13 years ago. Over the years, our 45MX has seen it's share of add-ons (the table it's mounted to is a 1970's era metal desk that my Dad was kind enough to make brackets for), but it's been reliably maintenance free.

That said, I didn't print much last winter due to scheduling conflicts and the heat flux within the space over a brutal summer no doubt did not help. Not afraid of a tear down I set about to not just realign, but also modify the swing in the lens board.

## Removing the swing

In my version of the 45MX, the bottom lens stage can be tilted and positioned, allowing you to correct perspective on a negative. Not all 45MX series enlarger had this feature and it just isn't one of those things that I've found much use for in practice. This, combined with the ball bearing and the locking nut to make his feature work, has a tendency to wander in my enlarger.

No longer wanting to deal with this, I decided to simply remove the ball bearing and put in a new 3/8" bolt and locking washers.

The problem is the lens stage and the back lens rail assembly have different holes sizes. The solution is to drill out the front lens assembly hole by about a 1/4".

Having dissabemled the bottom len stage from the focus rail and bellows, the front swing piece and 3/8" drill bit in the press, and we get a perfect bolt fit. Realigning the two pieces to be level and reattached, we get rid of any left+right wiggle.

## Reducing slack in focusing rail

On focus, I could feel the bottom stage shift left to right. This was unrelated to the swing and is caused by the nylon rails either being worn out or the bolts and set screws being too loose against the focus rail.

In my case, the nylon rails are in pretty solid shape on this enlarger, but you can see that I never replaced the initial hardware that came with the enlarger (some of which is clearly not from the stock enlarger setup). Besides showing signs of rust some of these bolts and set screws are simply not the correct size or length, which makes the rails not sit even or tightly.

The quick fix is to head on down to the hardware store and pick up some fresh #8-32 1/2 inch machine screws and some #4-40 1/4 inch machine screws. Now I, replaced the tiny 1/4 inch screw length with 1/2 inch just to make my life easier, but with the new screws in place and a careful replacement of the bottom assembly (being careful to align and not break the gear teeth)the focus slack is removed with very lttle need to preassure adjustment from the #4-40's.

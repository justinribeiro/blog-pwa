After weighing MBA programs and options, I have decided to attend the Masters of Business Administration program at the University of San Francisco.  I received acceptance in February, have paid my tuition deposit and will begin classes starting in August of this year.


I know some people are skeptical of the value of an additional degree (knowledge and money-wise), but I feel that it allows me to make more contacts and gain advanced knowledge that I find of value. It will also allow to me to do some business research, possibly in economics or management depending on the grant I hope to receive, which I think is not only invaluable to myself, but also to others in the business community.


I'm really quite excited about attending the University of San Francisco.  I've talked the people at the Graduate School of Management, and they seem very nice and have been extremely helpful. It's closer to home then I am now, and the business climate is difficult.  I always like a challenging academic program with a touch of rough and tumble business landscape.  Makes for fast thinking and sure standing.

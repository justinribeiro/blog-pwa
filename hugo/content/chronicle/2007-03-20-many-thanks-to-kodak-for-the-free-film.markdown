Many months ago, I had signed up for some sample film from Kodak, specifically their new 120 size Portra color film.  I had heard others had been receiving theirs, and had begin to think I had missed the cut.

But low and behold a roll tube arrived with four new rolls and a brochure of information on the new film.  I expect to be shooting this in the Rolleicord very soon!

Many thanks Kodak!

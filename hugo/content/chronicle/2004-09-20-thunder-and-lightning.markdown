I found myself caught in a precarious situation on Sunday afternoon near my home town of Riverbank.  Driving back to my parents house in the sunshine, I could see a very large thunderstorm a brewing, just about where my parents house is located.  Lightning was present, spiking from the heavens into pastures and corn fields.  It was quite the site...until I got closer.


I soon found myself in a blinding storm of hail and rain, with lightening cracking along both sides of the road.  This didn't bother me, until I noticed I was along a major line of steel power cable poles and wires.  Those lightning strikes seemed to be getting closer.


I did make it back to the house, but the damage was done.  this end of summer storm had caused some flash flooding, and more then likely ruined a good portion of the tomato harvest.  The crop duster's were out in full swing this morning trying to ward of mold from what was left.


Our corn fields hopefully will be fine.  The heavy rains will cause us delay in our chopping, and caused the corn to sag...a heavy wind would blow the crop straight over.


With all the incremental weather back east, you would never have guessed one day of rain, one major thunderstorm, could have cost so many people so much in California.  I find it ironic for reasons unknown.

Congratulations to Alisa and JD on there new little boy Finley Michael, who was born today at 6:47pm.  I don't have all the details or a picture yet, but I just wanted to pass along the great news!

Between my closest friends, whom I consider family, I now have two nephews and one niece, with another little one on the way. I'm just thrilled I get to give these kids candy when their parents aren't looking. I'm that kind of uncle. :-)
